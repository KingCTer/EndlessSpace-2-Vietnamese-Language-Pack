  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLCTemplarsTitle">Endless Space 2: Awakening</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLCTemplarsDescription">Endless Space 2â€™s fourth expansion brings a brand new faction to the Endless Universe: the Nakalim. A once-vast galactic empire that fell into decline when their gods, the Lost, were slain, this ancient race of devout explorers dreams of the day when those same gods return. The fact that they have been reawakened means half of their prophecy has come true. And the rest . . . ?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLCTemplarsLoreDescription">The Nakalim are the remains of an advanced starfaring race, and as such they retain much of their old skills and knowledge. Their science has atrophied, however, so to unlock technologies and sciences they must uncover the ancient places and relics that can return the power they once had.
Led by a young, impulsive queen who was thrust into power when her parents did not awaken, the struggle between the young and the old, the ancient and the new, will determine their future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLCTemplarsContentDescription">Endless Space 2: Awakening introduces the Nakalim playable Major faction as well as the Academy Empire. You will now be able to interact and negotiate directly with Isyander. As his grand plan begins to unfold and rumors of the Lost begin to circulate, the Academy is set to take a more active role in the future of the galaxy.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTemplarsTitle">Nakalim</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTemplarsDescription">The Nakalim developed on a dry planet towards the end of the reign of the Endless. Their reverence for the Lost made them an enemy of the Endless, but the Endless were too wrapped up in their civil war to worry about the Nakalim. Once the Endless fell, they were largely alone in a tamed and civilized galaxy full of the Endless's infrastructure. As result they grew so rapidly that they over-expanded, and the survivors were driven into hibernation--to wait for their prophecy of the Lost to come to pass.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AffinityGameplayTemplarsIntroductionDescription">The royal family of the Nakalim--your family--have ruled this empire since its inception. Worshipers of the Lost, they thrived and expanded under the benevolent guidance of a Lost they called Sobra, who had formed a loose Dyson structure around their planet. The murder of their god by the Endless, however, followed by scarcity and decline, drove them into a period of hibernation. Awakened now, as their prophecies foretold, they are ready to reach once more out into the galaxy, rediscover their ancient temples and Relics, and retake all that was once theirs--all that will be yours...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionOracularsTitle">Xirmisala</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionOracularsDescription">The Xirmisala are a people both ancient and unfortunate. Bioengineers of the Concrete Endless discovered these Dust-sensitive ungulates, and over time they altered the species to make them even more attuned to the presence and movement of Dust. When the Dust Wars started, therefore, the Xirmisala became critical to the war effort, and the Concretes exponentially increased their augmentation efforts. It was quite a success, as the Xirmisala abetted the Endless pogrom that led to the destruction of the Lost.
After the Lost fell they evolved on their own, but it was not long before they were discovered by the expanding empire of the Nakalim. Appreciating their skills, the Nakalim adopted the Xirmisala for a different reason: to seek out, against all hope, any Lost that may remain alive in the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroAffinityTemplarsDescription">Nakalim Heroes reflect the abiding religious faith of their empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars01Title">Morya Kupas</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars01Description">It is unlikely that there is a living Nakalim who has not heard of Kupas. Perhaps the oldest living Nakalim, her role as warrior for the church of Sobra has kept her going through generations of exploration and discovery of relics of the Lost and the Endless. In broadcasts, archaeological digs, and battlefields, she carries her faith like a weapon. For centuries her heart has burned with the injustice and outrage of the Day of the Blasphemy; the day that the Lost were first drawn to the Lodestones and butchered. A fearless, driven, stressful superior officer, she will not stop until the Lost return. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars02Title">Panako Nakatug</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars02Description">Born ages ago when the empire was at its apogee, Nakatug's service in the security forces of the Remembrance of Sobra church and later for the empire gained him fame as well as a fearsome reputation for precision and perfection. Enhanced by Dust over a period of decades due to his proximity to relics, his evolution into a Hero was a surprise even to himself. Eagerly accepting study at the Academy--an organization whose existence was predicted by the Sobratic Prophecies--he carried his attention to detail and relentless pursuit of perfection into his new role. Often fooled by his ancient and corrupt person, his colleagues soon learn Nakatug is a keen-eyed taskmaster. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars03Title">Nakatuon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars03Description">Having passed millennia of hibernation in solo contemplation of the most efficient ways of committing assassination, Nakatuon was thoroughly disoriented when, upon awakening, it found its mind coupled to all the other Remnants in existence. Their new purpose, as defined by Belcus Akad-Talar, was to build a better galaxy for the most deserving speciesâ€”a contradiction to everything it believed. Roaming from system to system, it pondered. Surely if the Remnantsâ€™ creators, the Endless, had made them killing machines, then that is what they should remain? Unlessâ€¦ unless this change of purpose meant that the Endless were perhaps not the benevolent overlords they had seemed to be. Nakatuon was still trying to make up its mind when it came across a Nakalim evangelical mission. They helped it understand this new view of the world and how things came to be, and now, Nakatuon has adjusted its mission to coincide with that of its new friendsâ€¦</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars04Title">Yr Mel Kara</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroTemplars04Description">As many Kal'Tik'Ma explorers, Mel began her life hunting for their lost home planet--covertly, not overtly. After all, who would pay to fund hopeless expeditions to lost stars? With time and experience she saw more, did more, and learned more, becoming Dust-enhanced by accident while seeking ancient Endless star charts in an abandoned asteroid outpost. Still, the sense of loss never left her. Meeting the Nakalim, who sympathized with her plight, she grew over time to adopt their religion and become a fervent believer. After all, to hope that the gods return seems to be as unlikely an event as to hope to find a dead planet around a ruined star... Though Mel is now a seeker of greater things, she still hopes to find, one day, within the wisdom of the relics, a key to the past of her people.</LocalizationPair>

When the Dust Wars started, therefore, the Xirmisala became critical to the war effort, and the Concretes exponentially increased their augmentation efforts. It was quite a success, as the Xirmisala abetted the Endless pogrom that led to the destruction of the Lost.
After the Lost fell they evolved on their own, but it was not long before they were discovered by the expanding empire of the Nakalim. Appreciating their skills, the Nakalim adopted the Xirmisala for a different reason: to seek out, against all hope, any Lost that may remain alive in the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LostTemplarsQuest-Chapter1-Part1-IntroDescription">I have not only lived through a prophecy, I have opened my eyes in wonder and seen it happen before me. 

This is my story. I am Marusia, of the royal Mapagna family, princess of the Nakalim.
-----
Our sleep was one of desperation. When Sobra was taken from us, when the Endless destroyed the gods, our civilization fell into decline. Centuries of growth and exploration descended into ruin and confusion in a matter of years; our vast galactic empire crumbled until the Nakalim, at risk of chaos and collapse, were driven into hibernation. 
Many were almost glad to do it, for a prophecy said this: " . . . the sleep of the faithful will be long, and the galaxy will change, and the stars shift in their places; yet in the end, when the time of the Rebirth is near, the faithful shall be awakened by a prophet . . ." There is more to it, as it was a prophecy, and they often go on like that.

Little did we imagine that this prophet would come with tales not only of the treachery of the Endless (as if we did not know), but of a great Tabernacle built to assuage their guilt and to beg the Lost for forgiveness, and of a new and glorious purpose for him and his followers. Most call it simply the Academy, but he whispered to us its full name: The Ultimate Academy of Truth and Repentance.
Now we are awake and alive, a reinvigorated people filled with a sense of purpose. But though I am glad to feel the sun upon my face once more, my first act will be to lay my parents to rest, for the long hibernation was too much for their aging bodies. So my story begins at a time of wonder, and prophecy, and loss.

This is my story. I am Marusia, of the royal Mapagna family, and it seems that I am queen of the Nakalim.</LocalizationPair>

-----
This is a situation that I did not expect. The population is not just "grumbling", not just "unhappy", they are striking and marching over questions of religious piety and propriety! I, queen of the Nakalim, who wears the title of Nakalim Defender, have had my leaderships and my faith called into question!

At this moment, I suppose, my anger matches theirs. Did they think we could rebuild an empire from the pews? Learn how to defend ourselves against new weapons by repeating rituals that date from thousands of years ago? I would have thought it was alien agitators, or foreign spies, but I have spoken with the Nakalim Lords and passed among the congregations. 

I did not realize the point to which they seek meaning, or solace, or something solid to cling to in a strange galaxy that they no longer understand. I lose time now, and I must put resources into petty projects that do not advance my cause nor my empire's future.

Though I suppose I should be happy that it is indeed "simple ignorance" . . .</LocalizationPair>

-----
The grumbling persists, but for the moment I think the risk of open revolt has lessened. But it is important to note that there is a long, long way between "lessened" and "disappeared".  How do I get it there? How do I turn those who are fanatically religious and somewhat loyal into fanatically loyal and somewhat religious? My detractors are still numerous, and obviously I understand why they say what they say.
After all, my desire to rebuild our empire could be placed anywhere on the scale from "courageous" to "maniacal", depending on the point of view. But I am hoping to create a master stroke; to settle once and for all the question of who leads and who follows. For my father was head of the Remembrance church, and carried the title "Defender of the Lost". My mother was the queen, the sovereign;  "Defender of the People". I have inherited my mother's title with the role.
But if I can take my father's title as well, ruling the church and the Nakalim Lords, there would be no force within the empire that could attempt to waylay or derail me. Never before in our history has a single Nakalim held both roles; it would be a first. On the other hand, no other Nakalim monarch has been awakened by a prophet of the Lost from centuries of sleep.

The ceremony to anoint me as Defender of the Lost occurred last week. For the first time in history, the two roles of Defender of the People and Defender of the Lost are held by a single Nakalim. The Ecclesiarchs and the people are fully behind me; for if they are not, then they are the apostates, for my word is law in the councils and in the pews.

I confess that I did not realize how constrained by tradition the daily ritual of the Defender is; I had seen it as a way to get more done, but with six daily prayers and frequent formal gatherings I think I need to be cloned.... sadly, that is viewed as heresy and I am too new in the post to demand it.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_TemplarsPopup-Description">The Nakalim are an ancient Empire, highly advanced in science thanks to leeching off the Endless long ago. However, this led to dependency, and slowly but surely they lost every impulse for scientific innovation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Templars2Popup-Description">The Nakalim rely on Relics, ancient artifacts that they can study. Possessing Relics provides the science that they can't obtain from planets. The Nakalim can also give Relics to Heroes in order to awaken new powers within.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Templars3Popup-Description">The Nakalim also have a unique system specialization called Temples. With a Temple they can increase their control over the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Templars_Academy2Popup-Description">Gifted systems will give you a permanent tithe of its resources. The Academy will also reward you with some Relics and other bonuses--and they will still count towards your victory condition.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetTemplarsDescription">The Nakalim have been on Sobra since their birth, and though it is heavily exploited they still view it as a gracious and civilized home. A more interesting fact is that the planet was once protected by a Lost, also called Sobra by the Nakalim, who guided and aided them over the long, slow growth of their culture. They feel the loss of their god to the weapons of the Endless keenly, and are dedicated enemies of that dead civilization. From Sobra they once built an empire that controlled much of the galaxy, and they are eager to rebuild it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion1Answer">The concept of "perfection" does not lend itself to a simple "yes" or "no". What is more perfect, a Sophon equation or a Hissho blade? An industrious anthill or an Obelisk of All Space-Time? But if you insist, and depart from the more philosophical aspects of the question, the answer is simple. By Horatio's standards the answer can only be: Yes. There could be nothing more perfect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion2Answer">Once the Vodyani leader and head of the Vodyani church, Isyander left the faith and his nation when learning more of the history of the Endless and the Lost. He changed his surname from 'St. Shaiud' to "ShumÃ¨d". His new name apparently means "seeker", but we do not know in what language.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion3Answer">Neither. The greatest military thinker of the Academy was a Hissho named Kochita, who looked at conflict from the lenses of space and time. A deep thinker and perhaps the galaxy's greatest strategist, his writings on power, development, diplomacy, and influence remain the most respected bibliography in all of the Academy's many libraries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion4Answer">We do not know all the details. What we understand is that the Dust crystal, which provided power to the ship, was also deeply impregnated with the knowledge of the Endless. We suspect that this was drawn from the vast Endless complex that was pillaged by the  survivors of the Mezari ship "Success". The crystal exploded, and the Dust was released, causing a vast sympathetic reverberation in Dust across the galaxy. It seems that the knowledge buried within the crystal was released, seeding--and accelerating--the scientific advances of nascent civilizations. Our research continues...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion5Answer">This is a question that we do not treat lightly out of both faith and respect. From the point of view of mortals they were gods, though a more technical answer would be "sentient volumes of primordial Dust". They had little purpose other than curiosity, discovery, and play. Many of the  great and strange natural wonders of the galaxy are likely artifacts of Lost inquisitiveness. But their physical value in Dust was immense, and the Endless took it upon themselves to butcher them for short-term gain.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoreQuestion6Answer">During the course of their scientific researches, the Endless learned to harness the gamma rays of dying stars and gravitational anomalies in the galaxy. While the ritual of contact and greeting at the Lodestones was likely seen by the Lost as quaint and amusing, out of curiosity and affection many of them would voluntarily make contact. On the Day of Blasphemy, gamma energy and gravitational disruption was used to capture them and draw the Dust from their forms.
Little is known of how or where the Endless developed this technology, as it seems that those who left the Tabernacle of Remorse went to great lengths to destroy the knowledge. However, we continue to seek...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedTemplarsLosing">Please, be gracious in your military dominance. The Nakalim wish for a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedTemplarsLosing">The Nakalim are grateful for your benevolence. Her Majesty accepts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedTemplars">I don't like that we call this a time of peace. It doesn't feel like peace. I am calling it a cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords will be disappointed that you end this period of peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedTemplars">This alliance is a farce. We, the Nakalim, will seek our re-ascendance by other means. We are now at cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty is happy to be at cold war. The alliance was an affront to decency.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords counsel me to break this truce, and go to war. And I am in agreement. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedTemplars">One day the Lost will judge you for your fickleness. War is it then.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedTemplars">For the sake of recovering our lost glory, I have no option but to declare war on your squalid empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim do not blanch in the face of adversity--and neither do I. You will have your war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedTemplars">Her Majesty doesn't shun the hard choices. We had a peace between us, but now we will have a war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim know well how to rise to greatness after a fall. Should your declaration of war lead to a setback, rest assured we will rise again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedTemplars">For the veneration of the Lost, this alliance must be annulled. And replaced by a state of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty is livid that you trample on our hard-won alliance and turn to war. You make a grave mistake.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim will make you regret a thousand times over your failure to maintain this truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedTemplars">It is time to thaw these cold relations. Her Majesty deems them unnecessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedTemplars">Empires always attain their greatest achievements during times of peace. The Nakalim welcome these new relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTemplars">I cannot help but feel that this offer of peace is not made with honorable intentions. Therefore I refuse it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderRefusedTemplars">I cannot help but feel that this offer of peace is not made with honorable intentions. Therefore I refuse it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedTemplars">The Nakalim seek an alliance. What greater honor could an empire receive?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords are in agreement with me. We would be happy to form an alliance for the glory of the empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedTemplars">We risk sullying the memory of the Lost accepting this alliance. Therefore, we refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderRefusedTemplars">We risk sullying the memory of the Lost accepting this alliance. Therefore, we refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedTemplars">Her Majesty deems this peace a strong foundation for a lasting alliance. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim will long remember this day as a glorious one. We accept the offer of an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedTemplars">I have informed the Nakalim Lords that I will refuse this offer of an alliance. Peace is sufficient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderRefusedTemplars">I have informed the Nakalim Lords that I will refuse this offer of an alliance. Peace is sufficient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedTemplars">Know that by accepting this proposal you will help a once magnificent empire get closer to its former glory...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim view this a favorable proposal. We accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedTemplars">How could you think an empire as noble and valorized as the Nakalim would agree to this proposal? Her Majesty refuses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderRefusedTemplars">How could you think an empire as noble and valorized as the Nakalim would agree to this proposal? He Majesty refuses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredTemplars">Let us never speak of this squalid proposal again!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedTemplars">The Nakalim never shy away from their choices.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedTemplars">The Lost watch all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedTemplars">Her Majesty sends her compliments. You lead wisely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedTemplars">Flattery is always welcome with the Nakalim, but don't think it will sway us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedTemplars">You are an embarrassment to the great empires of this galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedTemplars">Why do you think your pathetic insults would have any effect on the great Nakalim empire?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedTemplars">The Nakalim's wishes at this juncture are very simple. You would be wise to agree to this demand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedTemplars">Only the Lost may demand something of the great Nakalim empire. But perhaps you are one of their servants.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedTemplars">Didn't I say that only the Lost may demand something of the Nakalim? This desecration can only mean one thing: war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty did not make that demand lightly. You should've agreed. Now there can be only war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedTemplars">With trade both our empires can build great things. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTemplars">Trade is the foundation of the Nakalim's greatness. I accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedTemplars">You think the mighty Nakalim Lords would have any part of this grubby trade venture? You are badly mistaken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderRefusedTemplars">You think the mighty Nakalim Lords would have any part of this grubby trade venture? You are badly mistaken.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreemenSenderProposedTemplars">Do you wish to share the knowledge and faith of the Nakalim Lords?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTemplars">May science--and worship of the Lost--flourish in both our empires. I accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedTemplars">This offer smells of the ruthless amorality of the Sophons. I refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderRefusedTemplars">This offer feels too much like cold-blooded logic; the Nakalim are also beings of faith and philosophy. I refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedTemplarsHarassWar">The Virtuals have spoken. It is time for our fleets to plague your worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedTemplarsConquestWar">Our Most Holy Arks are ready to expand into new territory. Your territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedTemplarsPrepareWar">I am hardly surprised at your bloodthirsty decision. It is a small step from cold war to war, and the Nakalim Lords are ready take it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedTemplars">This offer feels too much like cold-blooded logic; the Nakalim are also beings of faith and philosophy. I refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedTemplars">I see that you have shut away your friends; I hope that isolation does not drive you to madness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords bring the light of faith and hope to your peoples; let us open our borders to each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedTemplars">I see much advantage to you in this, but little for me. The borders of my empire will remain closed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderRefusedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords will keep to their own temples and their own counsels. I will not open my borders to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords have requested a time of silence and privacy. I close the borders of my empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedTemplars">I ask you to open your borders to our trade vessels and our pilgrims; let us discover this galaxy together!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredTemplars">I am busy and have no time for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedTemplars">In the name of the Nakalim Lords, I greet one of the many peoples who have sprung up since this galaxy was ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedTemplars">I am queen of the royal Kupas family, first of the Nakalim Lords and ruler of their empire. Greetings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords are eager to refresh their knowledge of the shape of this galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedTemplars">I am content to discover the breadth of this galaxy together; it was once our territory, and is filled with our memories.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedTemplars">I am surprised that you don't covet the ancient eyes and vision of the Nakalim. Blind yourself, if you wish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty feels that you have insulted her! The Trade Agreement seemed useful to both of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedTemplars">The knowledge of the Nakalim Lords is deeper than any other civilization. I am surprised that you terminate our agreement!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedTemplars">I offer you to share the sight and the vision of the Nakalim. Perhaps we may even see traces of the Lost  . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedTemplars">I do not like the way you look at my territory. The faithful do not trust you; our vision sharing agreement ends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedTemplars">The Nakalim civilization once explored the galaxy. I propose we share the task this time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedTemplars">Few beings in the galaxy hold a store of scientific wisdom like ours; you would do well to share it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty is content that you see the superiority of her faith and culture. A Truce seems appropriate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedTemplars">I do not see this war serving my people, nor bringing back the Lost. I propose a Truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedTemplars">I do not start a war lightly, and I will not end it lightly, either.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderRefusedTemplars">I do not start a war lightly, and I will not end it lightly, either.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverRefusedTemplars">I know enough of the galaxy's territories from our histories. I have no need of your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderRefusedTemplars">I know enough of the galaxy's territories from our histories. I have no need of your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverRefusedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords see no reason for you to peer inside our temples and homes, and no need to peer inside yours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderRefusedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords see no reason for you to peer inside our temples and homes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialTradingPartnerTemplars">It is my hope that we might trade peacefully and profitably.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralPotentialFriendTemplars">Believers or no, I am glad to meet others who could be friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFirstImpressionTemplars">I rebuilt a great empire; as such, your donation is welcome and will be remembered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementSameAlignementTemplars">In our history we have seen many peoples. And in this case, we share your opinion of a particular one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGreatDeedsTemplars">We condone your just treatment of those fools and miscreants.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAskTributeTemplars">I seek to rebuild, find Relics, do justice to my family's memoryâ€¦ All of this comes at a great cost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouHurtMeTemplars">Her Majesty is not pleased that her people have been attacked!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationYouWereCruelToMeTemplars">How dare you harvest innocents like so much grain! Her Majesty will remember.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationGetOutAfterTrespassTemplars">I will one day lay claim to the galaxy. For now, I claim the space in which you trespass!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterTrespassingTemplars">Your trespassing has exhausted the patience of the Nakalim Lords. Act carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAfterColonizationTemplars">You wish to rub shoulders? Become friends? Is that why your colony is so close? Remove it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionTemplars">We remember when our empire controlled the planets you wish to colonize; we wish to do so again.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoColonizationProblemTemplars">We see you wish to be neighbors. Perhaps you will join us in prayers to the Lost?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassMilitaryTemplars">Her Majesty does not wish to see foreign fleets in her territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationRevengeTemplars">We have faith in those we trust. And we now have no faith in you!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarOpportunistTemplars">I strive to recreate a great empire; your weak defenses indicate that you don't mind if I do so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementProposePeaceTemplars">War takes time from prayer, from development, from growth. Let us stop this waste of lives.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDeceiverTemplars">Her Majesty sees your corrupt and perfidious ways. Watch your step!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockingExpansionTemplars">Have you not heard that Her Majesty wishes to rebuild a great empire? It will not go well if you try to block us into a corner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSneakyDemandTemplars">These demands stink of deception and falsehood. Her Majesty views you with contempt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralOpenBordersAcceptedTemplars">Let our peoples join in prayer, discovery, and trade. The galaxy is wide, with bounty for all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementTributeReceivedTemplars">The Nakalim Lords thank you for your tithe. Our faith and our people view you benevolently.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForExpansionTemplars">The call of our ancient temples is strong. We will find and rebuild them, wherever they lieâ€¦</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionTemplars">There are times when we must close the doors of the temple to think and to pray.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedTemplars">You show restraint, and the Nakalim Lords are grateful. I am grateful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedTemplars">Our great project moves forward; we thank you for your tithe in the support of our faith.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractTemplars">The galaxy is a sadder place without the Lost. Your willingness to exchange and bargain is a glimmer of light.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsTemplars">I viewed you as a risk and an unreliable threat, but you have shown yourself to be reasonable and peaceful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementUltimatumFulfilledTemplars">When we make demands in the name of the Lost, we appreciate the integrity of those who accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsTemplars">You attack the pious and the faithful? Her Majesty cannot accept this savagery.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedTemplars">Her Majesty judges your acts akin to urinating in our temples and burning our holy sites!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightTemplars">Her Majesty is no longer interested in soft diplomacy. She will now conduct it with fire and fury.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingTemplars">I do not casually profane your holy sites. Why do you trespass in our holy space?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationTemplars">He Majesty judges you colonization within our space as one step short of an armed invasion.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersTemplars">The doors of our holy space are closed to you. You may entreat the Lost to reopen them; for now, we will not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersTemplars">Her Majesty does not accept armed ships in her space any more than she would accept armed hostiles in her place of worship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsTemplars">You have chosen to spill the blood of the Nakalim and our allies. Her Majesty promises that you will regret this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonTemplars">We shall all be judged by the Lost, and do not wish them to see us taking your corrupt bribes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedTemplars">Did you pursue this long peace with the Nakalim Lords solely to make your betrayal more impressive? Her Majesty will see you grovel!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementTemplars">Though our philosophers are great, the Nakalim Lords would be desirous of sharing knowledge of other sciences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTemplars">I consider you valuable friends who also have things of value; perhaps we should consider trading more closely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementTemplars">Commerce and its exchanges are the lubrication of the galactic orrery; I would like to see more of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementTemplars">These long periods of peace give us time to seek truths and worship the Lost; I am content with these relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementTemplars">The Nakalim Lords have profited from our mutual trade and commerce; we are content with our commercial arrangements.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandOrTrespassedTemplars">The Church's fury will be white hot should these hostile actions continue. We hope you have acted in error.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementTemplars">The balance of progress and science with faith and devotion is never easy; I thank you for the advances we have learned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandTemplars">Her Majesty would be far more open to your discussions if they came as friendly requests rather than aggressive demands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyTemplars">Your ships are flashy and modern, but I prefer ours. Please take yours home where they belong.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceTemplars">I am glad that you have heeded the request of the Nakalim Lords, and left our space.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTemplars">You stomp through our space like Endless across the graves of the Lost. Her Majesty wishes you gone!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumTemplars">Her Majesty does not seek war, but your continued trespass obliges her to explain her anger in simple, violent acts you will understand.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureTemplars">I understand that building an empire is costly, but perhaps you could go a bit further to say "thank you"!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumTemplars">Her Majesty does not currently seek conflict, but if you continue to trespass there will be at least a cold war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassTemplars">The Nakalim Lords are content that your fleets no longer clutter their skies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureTemplars">Her Majesty works toward a great vision; your refusal to support it is unfriendly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureTemplars">You have shown yourself to be a generous ally. I am grateful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpTemplars">Her Majesty begs you to save us from another long hibernation. Enemies of the Lost seek our ruin!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceTemplars">There are evil alliances in the galaxy moving against the faithful; if we settle our differences and come together we could guarantee our mutual survival.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpTemplars">I fight so that neither the Lost nor the Nakalim be erased from history! Would you join with us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceTemplars">Empires full of hate and treachery ally against me! I offer you an alliance that will benefit all the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyTemplars">Other alliances sow blood and destruction as the Endless did. Would you join us in countering this madness?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsTemplars">I am pleased with our long and affluent peace. Perhaps things would be even better if we take this one step further?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryTemplars">We share principles and goals--perhaps we could share in a mutual victory? If we join in an alliance, our mastery of the galaxy is guaranteed!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpTemplars">Her Majesty calls upon her faithful allies to come to her aid!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyTemplars">An attack upon my ally is an attack on me! The forces of my empire will come to your aid.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftTemplars">Please take this gift as a show of my appreciation for your exemplary behavior.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftTemplars">If we did not worship the Lost already, perhaps we would worship you! This gift shows our high esteem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedTemplars">Making this demand upon me with no gesture of appreciation in return is hardly the act of an ally! Perhaps you do not take my support seriously?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandTemplars">The Lost can demand things of me; I am a faithful follower. But I am your ally, not your follower, and these demands you cannot make!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftTemplars">My people, our church, and myself, we all thank you for this extremely generous gift.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftTemplars">Her Majesty is unsure if this is intended as a gift or an insult.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedTemplars">I have not seen you support our efforts or my decisions, and you ignore my requests. Your intentions seem to be quite clear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateTemplars">The Lost cried out once, and aid for them came too late as well. This is history I do not like to see repeated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedTemplars">The memory of Her Majesty is long indeed, and your indifference to our suffering has left its mark.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftTemplars">Her Majesty is not pleased when you steal away the faithful! Conversion is not just bodies, it is souls.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleTemplars">Her Majesty has had enough of your conversions, creeping like a disease across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianTemplars">You have awakened a strange and ancient being. It seems to be connected to the Lost, however, and so I am pleased.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemTemplars">These relics of Lost powers that link systems together. . . They are strange, indeed, but I do not fear them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarTemplars">Her Majesty is beset on all sides by enemies and unbelievers. Your punishment will come in time!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandTemplars">We will not be choked into a corner, when the galaxy was once ours. I go to war, for the future of the Nakalim!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarTemplars">You are no stranger to using war for your purposes, so do not be surprised if I use it as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarTemplars">Your blockade threatens innocent lives. Her Majesty insists that you remove it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarTemplars">Her Majesty will put an end to your glee at the butchery of innocents.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarTemplars">I see you try to use Guardians to do your filthy work. My fleets will put an end to this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarTemplars">Her Majesty is enraged at your cold-blooded joy in the butchery of entire planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceTemplars">The Nakalim Lords believed we knew everything of this galaxy, but your singularities are a brand new marvel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceTemplars">Her Majesty notes that you try to warp space-time itself to conform to your evil plans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumTemplars">Conversion should be voluntary and spiritual. Your creeping propaganda will not be tolerated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumTemplars">Her Majesty sees that you are uninterested in peace, other than using it to simplify the theft of systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumTemplars">I thank you for resisting this urge to convert and control believers in the Lost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleTemplars">The placing of this singularity is a boon; you have my thanks for this peaceful gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleTemplars">You sin against the universe itself with your singularities! If you want war, at least have the courage to declare it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemTemplars">You throttle the living with your blockade. Her Majesty views you as no less evil than the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetTemplars">As the Endless butchered the Lost, you butcher my people. I will not rest until they are avenged.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonTemplars">Faith and hard work have given me another colony. Do not be unhappy with the faithful for their successful efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostTemplars">I see you have acquired the outpost! I have lost this round, but still have faith in the Nakalim and our future.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedTemplars">Her Majesty is displeased that you refuse her most reasonable request for tribute.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsTemplars">Her Majesty does not understand why you need to keep these fleets so close. She would prefer to see them from a greater distance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksTemplars">Why do you plague Her Majesty's subjects like some sort of ravaging horde? </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredTemplars">It is a time when the Nakalim Lords and our subjects wish to rest and pray. This is why I close my borders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarTemplars">I look first to the safety and security of my people. In this case, it means driving you back.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarTemplars">I follow my dream to retake the galaxy that was once ours, and your territory seems to be the ideal target.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetTemplars">As the Endless destroyed the Lost, you destroy a planet. You have earned Her Majesty's contempt.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetTemplars">The Nakalim Lords note the destructiveness of your power, though they may not appreciate its use.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetTemplars">You currently enjoy peaceful relations with Her Majesty, though your display of destructive power makes us wonder . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsTemplars">Her Majesty is insulted and offended at a declaration of war when she kindly agreed to your demands!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleTemplars">I am not the queen of a warlike people. Still, is it really peace if you force it upon me?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidTemplars">You force a peace upon Her Majesty? She will see if the situation warrants this imposition.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryTemplars">I did not think your intentions were remotely peaceful. I accept this imposition, but I do not trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureTemplars">The Nakalim Lords have made the peace you insisted on. But they remain unsure of your true intentions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceTemplars">I see that your forced peace was of little value; without further efforts of good will it is meaningless. And so, it dies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithTemplars">Her Majesty feels that offering more than mere words might tilt her decision in your favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedTemplars">I appreciate your offer and the spirit in which you gave it; we are content to have peace with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedTemplars">I hear words, I hear promises. However, I do not see any concrete manifestation of your supposed good faith.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionTemplars">So much for your forced peace. Her Majesty sees in your behavior an empire that understands nothing but war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedTemplars">I tire of your chatter, and I have much work to do. Begone.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationInvadedInCWTemplars">Your fanaticism against ours? I will see which one comes from true faith.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedColdWarTemplars">You steal worlds and disrupt lives for loot and glory. Should I wait for the reborn Lost to punish you, or do so myself?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedPeaceTemplars">Your pretended peace is a sham! You have stolen my system and ruined the lives of my people. It is an act of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedAllianceTemplars">Your treacheries are as great as the Endless; your theft of my system is an unacceptable betrayal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationObliteratedMySystemTemplars">You have slaughtered civilians and innocents! There is no greater casus belli.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationObliteratedASystemTemplars">Your random acts of destruction have been noticed, and you will be judged by them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidObliteratedASystemTemplars">Your violence and aggression is noted! Her Majesty things you will not stop until the galaxy and all its civilizations are in ruins.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationObliteratedAllySystemTemplars">You pretend cold war with me, while obliterating an ally's system? I will not accept this!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementObliteratedEnemySystemTemplars">Though your desire for destruction is worrisome, I am somewhat reassured by your choice of targets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralObliteratedMySystemTemplars">Your notion of war is incomprehensible. To me you are a force of ruin that would leave nothing alive in the galaxy!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceObliteratedAllianceSystemTemplars">I had hoped you would believe in peace, but your gratuitous destruction of an ally's system convinces me otherwise.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAllianceObliteratedMySystemTemplars">What manner of treachery is this?! You have destroyed my system--an ally's system! You are replaying the perfidy of the Endless . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAllianceObliteratedAllySystemTemplars">No. You cannot destroy an ally's system and expect there to be no consequences. Her Majesty will not tolerate this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNeedHonorTemplars">In the name of the Lost and the rebirth of their glory, we must set loose the dogs of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionForcedPeaceRelationReceiverSignedTemplars">Her Majesty is not the queen of a warlike people. Yet you force peace upon her, as if it is another form of conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualFleetRemovalDialogueTemplars">I insist that you remove the  fleets that trespass in Nakalim territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualColonizationConcurrenceDialogueTemplars">I insist that you remove your colonies that infringe on Nakalim territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualFleetDefenseDialogueTemplars">I insist that you cease your hostile attacks on Nakalim fleets and systems.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ContextualFleetRemovalIsolationistCWDialogueTemplars">You trespass upon space that is holy to the Lost, Her Majesty insists that you leave.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationReceiverSignedTemplars">We are not pleased with this. Sobra was permitted to make demands of us; you are not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSenderSignedTemplars">It is the will of the Lost, and therefore, of the Nakalim Lords.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGiftReceiverTemplars">We are pleased and honored to be held in your esteem. I thank you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGiftSenderTemplars">Please accept this as an example of my esteem for your works.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementSenderSignedTemplars">The Queen seeks other things in this life than mere Dust, and your agreement barely even brought that.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionFactionPactSenderProposedTemplars">As Queen of the Nakalim Lords and leader of a devout people, I offer you this proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionFactionPactReceiverRefusedTemplars">The Queen does not see value in your proposal, and she will not accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionFactionPactSenderRefusedTemplars">The Queen does not see value in your proposal, and she will not accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionFactionPactReceiverSignedTemplars">As children of the Lost we see value in your proposal. I accept for my people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelFactionPactReceiverSignedTemplars">You have the honor of the Endless, who dared even to stab their gods in the back!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%OutGameScanViewTemplarsContent">The Nakalim developed on a dry planet towards the\n end of the reign of the Endless. Their reverence for\n the Lost made them an enemy of the Endless, but the\n Endless were too wrapped up in their civil war to\n worry about the Nakalim. Once the Endless fell, they\n were largely alone in a tamed and civilized galaxy full\n of the Endless's infrastructure. As result they grew so\n rapidly that they over-expanded, and the survivors\n were driven into hibernation--to wait for their\n prophecy of the Lost to come to pass.</LocalizationPair>
