  <LocalizationPair Name="%Update11Description">Thanks to a massive participation in August 2018 Free Weekend, the community unlocked 7 Ship Skins available now with the free Renegade Fleets Update.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Update11Title">Renegade Fleets Update</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DephasedCustomSkinOptionDescription">Particles in zones inhabited by Riftborn are occasionally redshifted as a temporary adaptation to slow the local effects of corruption. This is an aftereffect of their time manipulation technologies, but has become an important tool in itself to offset some of the problems that their equipment—and ships—encounter in the Endless galaxy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%MavrosCustomSkinOptionDescription">Though the Sophons are occasionally jealous of the swaggering, alpha-being image of the Mavros, in fact they believe that the Mavros are too erratic to do anything of value (i.e. serious research). However, every once in a while, the Sophons like to remind other civilizations that they are entirely capable of blowing up other people’s moons as well...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MavrosCustomSkinOptionTitle">Sophon "Mavros" skins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FirekeepersCustomSkinOptionDescription">The Firekeepers have the critical role of tending the brush fires that support the Unfallen life cycle. The fires both remove scrub to prepare the fields to receive a new generation of Firsts, but also melt the resin that covers and protects the incredibly hardy Unfallen seeds. These ceremonial hulls commemorate the dedication of this organization.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PathfindersCustomSkinOptionDescription">When Isyander St. Shaiad decided to throw away his lifetime of beliefs in the Church of the Virtual Saints and become Isyander Shumèd, he changed more than just his name. He rebuilt his own Cloth and the armor of his ships in crimson and white, the colors that he believed were initially used on the Endless altars to the Lost. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PathfindersCustomSkinOptionTitle">Vodyani "Heretic" skins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PirateCustomSkinOptionDescription">A little piracy between friends was common before the relations between the Four Families became structured and formalized. While this hull cladding is a nod to those earlier times, there are also rumors that some fleets bearing these colors did not originate from Lancellum dockyards, but a rogue operation run by a shadowy figure known as Captain Roth.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VermilionCustomSkinOptionDescription">Horatio liked emerald green this weekend. That is all.</LocalizationPair>
