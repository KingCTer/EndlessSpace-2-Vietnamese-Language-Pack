  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBasryxo01Title">Fore Sagazh Jabble</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBasryxo01Description">Growing up, Jabble never quite had the wit and the reflexes to match their curiosity. Adolescence was one long series of accidents and hospitalizations as Jabble wandered into places they shouldn’t have and pulled on levers with large “Do Not Touch” signs. Finally, one day, fate turned against them, and Jabble found their way into a discarded engine core that had been used for testing a highly radioactive Dust-enhanced ramscoop. Assaulted by the forces that shape the boundaries of space-time, a wiser being might have died of terror and relentless perspective. Jabble simply thought, “Wow, cool”, and passed out. Upon awakening it was clear that they were no longer the same creature, but would have continued their carefree existence had not an explorer ship sent by Ighszraasz the Distrustful arrived to study the planet. Awed by the Academy and the incredible amount of neat stuff to check out, Jabble became a happy member of the society of Heroes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBasryxoTitle">Basryxo </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionBasryxoDescription">This society evolved in the detritus of what is essentially a garbage planet, as myriad forms of waste were dumped on the world for centuries. Whatever starfaring race created this ecological disaster we do not know, but eons after their passing a new sentient life—perhaps remnants of the original civilization, perhaps something else that evolved in the mutation-rich environment—came to be. Starting from ragged scavengers to become pragmatic and efficient recyclers, they have learned to turn garbage into gold. Any planet lucky enough to welcome them will quickly see the effectiveness of their methods for recovering resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-IntroTitle">Munchie Madness</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-IntroDescription">The coolest, tastiest treat across the galaxy is a new fast food, Haroshuarm, a traditional snack of the Haroshem. The trend has taken settled planets like a storm, and anywhere you go you can buy or order a couple of pre-fermented slabs of this cheap, delicious fodder. Unfortunately, the incredible leap in take-out consumption has created vast quantities of garbage, exacerbated by the fact that decaying Haroshuarm turns into a corrosive gas. As a result, waste treatment plants and trash collection companies are staggering under mountains of cardboard and plastic rubbish that is slowly devolving into toxic waste. 
It is a particular challenge for the Basryxo, who pride themselves on turning trash into treasure. Ths time, they may have met their match.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-1Title">HAPPINESS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-1Description">The masses are content? Let's keep them that way!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-1ObjectiveTooltip">Your Empire Approval directly depends on the Approval of your Systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-1Outcome">Nice work! Other than some minor side issues like obesity and flatulence, everybody is happy--except the Basryxo, who still can't figure out how to get rid of all the effluent.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part1-3Outcome">Your Edict for Non-lethal Packaging and Waste Reduction has been a great success. The new recyclable, absorptive Haroshuarm boxes are a great help in reducing piles of waste, and the city streets are once again navigable. Rumor has it, however, that the natural curiosity of the Basryxo has driven them to finding a process to convert the old heaps of refuse into salt, hydrogen, carbon fiber, and chocolate.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest27_Part2A-1Outcome">As the Basryxo say, "Mind over muck". By developing new systems for garbage removal, improved yeast strains, and self-cleaning sacks for the food, ecological disaster is avoided and the Haoshuarm craze continues.
