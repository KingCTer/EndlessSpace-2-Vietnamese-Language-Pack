  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest04IntroTitle">Ice Age</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest04IntroDescription">According to your scientists, this icy planet holds a secret: it was once a planet-sized factory owned by the Endless, the first spacefaring people to harness the power of Dust. The Endless are extinct now, but if they left any traces of their civilization behind, they'd be frozen miles under the surface.

Perhaps their archaeological remains may still hold valuable lessons for you and your empire. But how will you dig through all that ice?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest04Failed">This Quest has failed</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest04Choice01Outcome">Despite all your efforts, not much of the Endless civilization remains here: it seems a long succession of sentient species inhabited this planet in the eons after the Endless's demise. Traces of the Endless have been all but wiped out.
It wasn't a complete waste of time, however. You managed to unearth a set of ancient ship technology blueprints that seem to perform very efficiently, even by modern standards.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest08IntroTitle">Foreign Contaminant</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest08IntroDescription">One of your exploratory drones, used by your team for rapid planetary assessment, has disappeared. According to your lead technician, this type of drone has a particularly low malfunction rate. He thinks it was intentionally sent off course by someone... or something.
The drone has a cargo bay for collecting samples. Perhaps if you find it, you might discover what happened to it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest08Choice01Outcome">A strange sight greets the expedition team at the second site. The drone is partially sunk in swampland, close to another abandoned vessel. From the tangled growths ensnaring the vessel, it's clear it's been here a long time. You find no sign of any crew, but do manage to reactivate the craft. It'll make a useful addition to your fleets. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest24-IntroDescription">The Galactic Census is coming up, and although you have greater worries on your mind, you remember what one of your wisest advisors once said: that a great leader is often judged not by his actions, but by the statistics he leaves behind.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-IntroTitle">The Lost Expedition</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-IntroDescription">The expedition made landfall days ago, but nothing has been heard since they entered a region of mild seismic activity on the second day. Electromagnetic analysis of the region suggests that their communication equipment should still be functional, so lack of contact is unlikely to have a technical cause. What should you do? Stay loyal to the missing team and send another party down to investigate? Or keep everyone aboard, and not expose them to unknown risks? You have a bad feeling about this . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice01Title">Rescue</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice01Description">You owe the expedition team your loyalty--after all, who will serve you in the future if they think you will abandon them at the first sign of danger? Your scientific counsel, however, has advised you that the action is not without risk. They estimate a 20% chance of the entire Fleet undertaking the search being lost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice01Objective">Search the Curiosity on the planet $QuestPlanetName if you're ready to sacrifice $Amount01Name [Strat02hyperiumColored] #EAD085#hyperium#REVERT#… and maybe your Fleet.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice01Outcome">The rescue party touches down on the planet, close to the site of the last known contact . . .</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice02Title">Protect</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice02Description">Only a fool would repeat the same action, and expect a different result. Without more information, mounting a rescue expedition would only jeopardise the lives of more of your people. It's an unpalatable truth, but sometimes exploring alien worlds is dangerous. The best you can do is honor the memories of those who were lost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice02Objective">Rename the $MyColonizedSystemLocationName System to honor the lost.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest25-Choice02ObjectiveTooltip">If this System is lost before you change its name, you'll fail the quest. To rename a System, go in it management view and click on the existing name and write a new one.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-IntroTitle">Quick Learners</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-IntroDescription">Though the Vaulters began their journey through the stars as an almost medieval society, their adaptability and intelligence have turned them into an efficient, advanced workforce. From the fearful refugees on the Argosy to the confident craftsmen and explorers of today, this people has come a long way.
Sadly, they are torn between those who feel nostalgia for their past, and others who have an overt desire to forget it. Something needs to be done to either turn the former away from melancholy, or to help the latter remember their traditions. For if serious schisms form within the Vaulters, their innate drive to take care of the clans first will make everything else secondary--work, politeness, and public order included.
  </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-Choice01Title">THE DUST</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">If your Vaulter population falls to 0, this quest will fail.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-Choice01Outcome">Though occasionally dour and begrudging, a concerted effort to improve living conditions and invest for the future brings positive results. Though they are no more garrulous, the Vaulters do at least crack an occasional smile.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-Choice02ObjectiveTooltip">If your Vaulter population falls to 0, this quest will fail.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PopulationQuest15-Choice02Outcome">Starting with workshops in schools and extending to adult education and social clubs, a renaissance of ancient techniques for crafting metal, cloth, and leather create a greater appreciation for their ancestors. The Vaulter population is happier, and some now make a living crafting traditional objects.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventReveal04-Title">A Cold Homecoming</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventReveal04-Description">You have found Auriga, the place from which your people departed ages ago. There seems to be no sign of life; the fate of those you left behind will require further investigation.

It seems, however, that the leader of the League was as wily as his reputation indicated, as he has escaped with a small but powerful fleet to continue his briefly interrupted career.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementQuestVaulters06Description">Given the generations that the Vaulter's ancestors spent toiling beneath the frozen and tainted Aurigan surface, it is no surprise that they became masters at finding every conceivable use for the rare minerals and weird bioforms they discovered in the darkness.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVaultersTitle">Vaulters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionVaultersDescription">An ancient faction, the Vaulters suffered continual setbacks in trying to establish a permanent home for themselves. Not so much restless wanderers as adaptable pragmatists, their centuries of travel and tinkering have made them skilled at both science and warfare. Defense remains their preferred military strategy, and their grim tenacity makes them effective defenders. They have a tradition of appointing female leaders, and their history of escaping and surviving to fight another day continually reaffirms it. The Vaulters left the planet of Auriga when potentially cataclysmic geo-atmospheric problems were detected. Having left their homes, gods, and many of their people behind them, the dream of regaining these things has gained an almost mythical status.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionSistersOfMercyTitle">Sisters of Mercy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionSistersOfMercyDescription">Having known only the harsh world of Auriga, the Sisters of Mercy are adapting to the strangeness of life in space with some difficulty. Fortunately, their study and travel with the Vaulters has alleviated some of their shock and sense of displacement. As they attempt to rebuild a functioning society in this alien galaxy, they cling more than ever to their mission: Dispensing death or salvation as the situation merits.  The practicing clans of the Sisters of Mercy try hard to separate the relative aspects of any situation--technology, cultural norms, history--from the absolutes of their faith--the belief in a universally applicable sense of right and wrong, and the responsibility to treat harshly those who cross the line between them.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVaulters04Title">Rill Kata</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroVaulters04Description">A promising young student of mechanisms and mathematics on Auriga, Kata converted to the Community of the Great Orrery after a near-death experience at fifteen when necrotic tissue in her foot almost took her life. The salvaged auto-medic apparatus that amputated the decaying limb and grafted on an artificial foot both saved her life and altered her outlook on the world.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSistersOfMercy01Description">Parcha had both the doom and the honor to leave Auriga and cross the stars when the Vaulters repaired the Argosy and departed. She travels with her family heirloom, the Book of the Kjrtys, an ancient tome filled with proverbs, anecdotes, and prayers. Whatever shadows or demons lurk behind the emotions that provoke a given situation, the Book is intended to provide her with the clarity of absolutes to deal with the problem. She discovered, however, that multiple layers of sentience, culture, and civilization impose far more complexity than her simple philosophical training provided. In search of greater answers, she visited the Academy and became one of the very few non-Dust-enhanced individuals admitted to its inner sanctum and taught its secrets. Fascinated by her experiences on Auriga, Isyander himself ensured that Parcha mastered Dust and became a full member of the Academy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroPirateLeader01Description">A rough character from a rough culture, Gurk’Zvar would have been a hard case even if his drunken stepfather had not named him Fluffpetal. A name like that in Gnashast society made bullying a daily occurrence throughout his youth. Before he learned anything else, Gurk'Zvar learned how to win fights or talk his way out of them. Showing a lot more smarts than his parents, Gurk'Zvar figured out that more friends and more people who owe you favors translated into more clout on the streets. From gang leader to mob boss was relatively straightforward, and once he took his first trip off-planet it was clear that nothing short of ruling his own pirate empire would be enough for this bright and belligerent personality.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VaultersQuest-Chapter1-Part1-IntroDescription">We left Auriga millennia ago--but to us it feels like yesterday. 
Slumbering in our pods aboard the Argosy, time was only marked by cold, fleeting dreams drawn out over centuries. Upon awakening I could still remember a million details of the day of our departure: the biting winter wind; the smell of the ash-fires along the route to the vessel; the bone-shaking rumble of the engines as we speared into the icy depths of space and Auriga receded to nothing. Most of all, the guilt, black and heavy in the pit of my stomach, for the kin we left behind.
I might have been overwhelmed by these memories, had it not been for the crisis that greeted my waking.
Our carefully restored craft, the life-saving Argosy, had suffered a grievous wound. Some cataclysmic explosion had knocked us off course, playing havoc with our systems. Opbot--brave, loyal Opbot--did everything it could to avert catastrophe and get us back on course. But even its heroic efforts weren't enough, for eventually the power failed and we were left to drift. It is nothing less than a miracle that we awoke, circling that Endless ruin adrift in space. Our priority was settling a world and surviving. Even if this planet is not a home, it will at least be a refuge. 
And so here we are, possibly safe, and yet immediately plunged into another crisis. For no sooner had we planted the Vaulter flag into this alien soil than we lost our talisman, the ancient machine who saved so many of us by guiding us through the long night.
Opbot has disappeared.
We scoured the local caverns and crevices, the cliffs and bogs, the treetops scanning the wilderness. But the truth is even stranger. As we skim, I hear news from the base, even the rushing wind and the radio crackle unable to disguise the words.
"One of the interstellar shuttles is missing," the voice says. "Opbot must've left the system."</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VaultersQuest-Chapter1-Part2A-IntroDescription">Opbot's location and its reasons for disappearing remain a mystery. As much as I would like to dwell on that, I have other requests that I must respond to. The greatest is the demand of my kin to answer the myriad unanswered questions about our own past:
Where was the world of Mezan, from which legend says we once came? What remains of its people? And where is Auriga, once our home, now lost in the galactic cloud since the Dust explosion shifted the Argosy and confused our navigation systems? 
My kin have done well, so I will do this for them rather than urging them forward. In truth, I am concerned that until their queries about our past are answered, they will not be ready to look ahead. 
My thoughts have now turned to the Argosy, which has been re-supplied and refurbished in the rush of colonization. In the age when it was built the vessel was an interstellar ship, and we may now have the ability to recover information from its records that we could not have obtained years ago. 
At the same time, we will interrogate other species and other sources of information. Anomalies, the highly Dust-active lodes of special resources, anything that can tell us of the evolution and history of this galaxy is of value.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VaultersQuest-Chapter1-Part2B-IntroDescription">Opbot's location and its reasons for disappearing remain a mystery. As much as I would like to dwell on that, I have other requests that I must respond to. The greatest is the demand of my kin to answer the myriad unanswered questions about our own past:
Where was the world of Mezan, from which legend says we once came? What remains of its people? And where is Auriga, once our home, now lost in the galactic cloud since the Dust explosion shifted the Argosy and confused our navigation systems? 
My kin have done well, so I will do this for them rather than urging them forward. In truth, I am concerned that until their queries about our past are answered, they will not be ready to look forward. 
My thoughts have now turned to the Argosy, which has been re-supplied and refurbished in the rush of colonization. In the age when it was built the vessel was an interstellar ship, and we may now have the ability to recover information from its records that we could not have obtained years ago. 
At the same time, we will interrogate other species and other sources of information. The lairs of other drifters in the galactic starlanes are also centers of information, however they may have obtained it. They may be pirates, but to desperate Aurigans they could also be useful associates.  The galaxy moves and expands; worlds and systems are moving targets and our science still lacks the accuracy to track them.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VaultersQuest-Chapter3-Part1-IntroDescription">Against my will, three days of mourning were declared.

Every day that slips by is one of lost opportunities and missed chances; do my kin not see that we have to strive constantly if we are to be the ones in control of our destiny?
There are still Aurigans that are alive, and my role is to see them flourish. Not merely survive.
It was at this moment that a strange message came. Isyander, leader and founder of the Academy, has somehow heard of us, but more importantly, of our interest in Auriga. What interest could he have, this suit-entombed being with an unknown past and inscrutable loyalties? I do not feel strong enough to ignore or insult Isyander, so I accepted an audience with two of his Heroes--two of his Dust-enhanced superbeings. It is interesting to be in the presence of equals.
But what they had to say was even stranger. Isyander claims not only knowledge of our history on Auriga, but knowledge of the kin we left behind. For the diplomats claim that there is a good reason that we found signs of life but not the bodies, nor the graves. They claim that some of our kin and "other beings of interest" are still alive, elsewhere in the galaxy.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%VaultersQuest-Chapter3-Part2-IntroDescription">The Heroes of the Academy and their leader, Isyander, have many awe-inspiring attributes. Brilliance, cleverness, rapidity of thought and of action, vast knowledge and understandings of both the past and the future. One of their great weaknesses, however, is pride. Or perhaps hubris. They speak in front of me in a rapid, coded language as if I would not understand it; they gesture between themselves in ways that they think are imperceptible. Yet I have been reading the body language of alien species for centuries, and I am enhanced in ways that would surprise them. Their thoughts and intentions are an open book to me. Did it never occur to them that First of the Bloodline is more than a simple matriarch of a primitive people? 
I have seen through their hints and mentions of other "beings". I know what they have as a bargaining chip to exchange for information about our lost kin. They have Opbot. 
I will not know the details until I speak with it myself, but it seems that Opbot made his way to the Academy. Or perhaps agents of Isyander made their way to Opbot; the details are not yet clear.
But they will be. This I swear.
So this will be what they will request of us: The extraction of the memory banks from the Argosy, so that Isyander and his geniuses might learn more of Auriga. In return, Opbot will be released to us with information about our lost kin. The deal seems simple and obvious, but it leaves too many questions unanswered. How and why did Opbot end up there? Why does Isyander show such an obsession with us--or with Auriga?

Rumors tell of his blazing desire to uncover the secrets of his "Lost", and to repatriate to the Academy any relics or ruins that pertain to them. We have been--carefully-- tracking Academy fleets, and they have accelerated their explorations of the strange and ancient planets of the galaxy. Planets with Endless ruins appear to be of interest, but those with ruins even older than the Endless seem to be their most sought-after prizes. Curiously; one planet that seems to be of great interest is the barren planet of Mezan. None of us can guess what Mezan has to offer, but if it is interesting to Isyander, it is interesting to me. I have heard other rumors about our own origin, and I will not pass up the opportunity to tag along and see what the geniuses of the Academy might discover about the Vaulters!

Opbot takes everything in its stride, somewhat distantly and politely, perhaps amused rather than appreciative. I do not know if it feels things like affection or happiness, but I am sure of one thing: It prefers being among people that trust and respect it. Unlike the tinkerers at the Academy, we have no desire to dissect Opbot in order to understand what makes it so unusual.
But Opbot has returned with something equally precious: information on the destination and fate of our kin who left Auriga long after we did. During the centuries we slept they changed and evolved, for it was only by reactivating Endless technology, discovered deep within the heart of Auriga, that they were able to depart. 
I had to sit down when I heard this news; it is one thing to hope, and quite another to see those hopes materialize. We have information and a destination. We know that there are Aurigans, other Vaulters, out there in the galaxy, long cut off from the kin who took the Argosy. However they may have changed and whatever they are now does not matter. They are still my kin, they are still my responsibility, and I will not stop until all of my kin is reunited.

The Vaulters are reunited and reinvigorated. There is a galaxy out there to be explored and controlled, and beyond that, uncountable other galaxies. Forward, Vaulters, beyond the stars!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DLCVaultersLoreDescription">Leaving their home planet of Auriga behind in a desperate gamble for survival, the Vaulters find themselves drifting through space after a cataclysmic Dust explosion. They must settle a new system and strike out to find security for their people--then discover the fate of those they left behind. Led as always by the indomitable Zolya Ilona, First of the Bloodline, the Vaulters are still masters of military defense and scientific discovery. And, with luck, they will finally be masters of their own destiny...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Vaulters01Popup-Description">The Vaulters start off at a Special Node, the Rejuvenation Field
They have a "Super Colonizer" ship (the Argosy) which is able to create a Colony directly (without first developing an Outpost).
Your first task is to find a System for your initial Colony--the faster, the better!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Vaulters02Popup-Description">Notice that the Senate and Technology screens are locked in addition to the Quest and Diplomatic Screens.
Unlike all other factions, you don't start with a Colony. Until you have one, you cannot produce Science and Dust, build Improvements, etc. Your population is much more focused on survival  than on politics!
Find a good star system: explore with the Argosy via the starlanes.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Vaulters03Popup-Description">The Argosy can #FFFF00#colonize#REVERT# this System.
Each colonization will trigger a Golden Age, during which more resources are produced and Heroes gain experience more quickly.
Note: Vaulters will suffer higher penalties if they colonize too many systems.

After colonizing this planet the Argosy will need $Amount01Name [turn] to refuel and reload.
Even if it has been damaged and repaired, you may have still have to pay a cost to colonize if the ship is not ready: $Amount02Name additional [turn] cooldown but this duration also depends on the existing colonies amount.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Vaulters04Popup-Title">Vaulters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Tutorial_Vaulters04Popup-Description">Congratulations, you have created your first Colony!
Note this building: #FFFF00#$PortalBuildingName#REVERT#. This is a Portal that lets your fleets teleport between your systems.
If you build another $PortalBuildingName in another colony, your fleets will be able to teleport instantly from one to the other. 
Vaulters don't need to have their systems close to each other for defense; they are always nearby if you have built Portals.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoAttacksSufferedVaulters">You relent in your desires to take the lives of my people. As First of the Bloodline, I may begin to trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDemandAcceptedVaulters">I do not mean to be cruel or arbitrary. I simply do what I must for the Aurigans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPositiveContractVaulters">We struck a bargain that benefits everyone. There's nothing wrong with that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNoHostileActionsVaulters">Vaulters seldom forget enemies. But we prefer to see them become friends.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumAttackedUnitsVaulters">At least you show the honesty of direct attack, rather than pretending your ships were just passing through. Commendable, for vermin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationUltimatumDisregardedVaulters">Apparently you do not take a firm warning from the Aurigans seriously. You insult me and my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightVaulters">I do not care if it is ignorance or aggressiveness. You have decided to ring the bells of war, and the Aurigans do not fear that sound.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationTrespassingVaulters">Theft of our systems, disrespect of our borders. Your list of provocations grows long, and the famous Vaulter temper grows short.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationColonizationVaulters">You treat our territory as if it was your playground. The colony you established is not welcome, and if we come it will not be to play.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersVaulters">Vaulter territory is closed to you. The kin are content to keep you out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersVaulters">Your constant trespassing reminds us of the incursions of Necrophage scouts. We preferred to slaughter Necrophage scouts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsVaulters">You will see the Aurigans are an adaptable people. We do not fear cold war or the heat of battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonVaulters">Take your Dust and trinkets elsewhere. We would not be bribed by the Clans, and we won't be bribed by you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedVaulters">This is the behavior we expect from Necrophage insects. Like insects, you will be exterminated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementVaulters">The Aurigans seek many things. Knowledge is precious, and a pooling of our scientific wisdom would benefit all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementVaulters">We could better secure our future if we could better secure our revenue. We wonder if a commercial agreement would aid both my kin and your people.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulPeaceAcknowledgementVaulters">I speak not only for myself, but for my kin. All Aurigans are content that our peaceful relations have endured when so much else seems ephemeral.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulTradeAgreementAcknowledgementVaulters">It is good to see the kin thrive; our trade agreement has done much good for the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandOrTrespassedVaulters">I would like an explanation for your actions. Is our Peace no longer useful to you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementVaulters">There is little the Aurigans value more than science, and our agreement has helped us improve our research. Let us hope this cooperation continues.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandVaulters">Would it not be more polite and less abrasive to ask, rather than demand? We do not--or did not--view you as an enemy of the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyVaulters">We note your friendly ships in our space. We Aurigans trust that they plan to remain friendly, and our relationship cordial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceVaulters">We do not wish to appear demanding. But as First of the Bloodline I have the task to maintain the sovereignty of my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVaulters">Why are your fleets in our territory? It is like waking up and finding Necrophages have invited themselves to breakfast.  You are not ready for a lasting peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumVaulters">Perhaps I was not clear. The Aurigans do not want your fleets in our territory. We insist that you remove them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureVaulters">You were happy to make a demand on my people, yet you feel no need to thank or compensate us. Perhaps you should consider that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumVaulters">Aurigans tire of waking up and seeing your fleets at our door. You have decided to end this peace; we will move to a status of cold war if practical.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassVaulters">I thank you for removing your fleets from Vaulter territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureVaulters">You refuse point blank to make a gesture of thanks or reconciliation? We are no longer interested in agreements and discussions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureVaulters">I speak for all my kin; we are somewhat reassured by your gesture. Remember that diplomacy is a delicate art, and your hands appear clumsy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpVaulters">The kin are under pressure; powers of the galaxy that we are ill-prepared to repulse are arrayed against us. What would you say if the Aurigans were to extend a hand?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceVaulters">I see alliances forming that risk doing great damage to my kin. The Aurigan Federacy is beginning to consider alliances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpVaulters">While we share peaceful relations, others are more willing to do harm to my kin. I wonder if you would consider joining with us. That galaxy is large enough that we can share!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceVaulters">As great alliances form, the Aurigan Federacy feels isolated. Frankly, I am considering proposing an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyVaulters">We are like doctors, fighting a common plague. My kin begin to wonder if a formal alliance would serve both our interests better.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsVaulters">We have been at peace, you and I, as have our people. My kin are content with this, and voices have begun to whisper thoughts of an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryVaulters">The shape of power in the galaxy becomes clear. You and I lead our peoples down the same path to success. As allies, this success might become even more secure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpVaulters">By tradition and by contract, the Aurigans request your aid in our current conflict!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyVaulters">I am sometimes chastized for treating my people too much like family. But such is my weakness, and as an ally, you too are family. And family comes first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftVaulters">I give you this in thanks for our continued good fortune in this alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftVaulters">Please accept this heartfelt expression of the Aurigans appreciation for our ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedVaulters">When friends begin to make demands without a gesture of appreciation, it means the friendship is over. The Aurigans regret what we must do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandVaulters">I would have thought that the status of "ally" made demands unnecessary. That is how Aurigans treat our friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftVaulters">We have seen alliances threatened before, but usually from without. Had you not made this gift, ours would have been threatened from within.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftVaulters">I feel that our alliance holds little value for you; a true friends and ally would understand the difference between "gift" and "pittance."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedVaulters">Ages of seeking and suffereing have made the Vaulters strong and adaptable. We may perhaps adapt to this alliance in its current form, in spite of your past actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateVaulters">I speak for my kin when I say better late than never. Would that your aid might have come sooner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoHelpReceivedVaulters">I do not beg. But I do remind you of our alliance and of your promises. You have spurned my kin in our time of need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftVaulters">You may call it a pleasant name like "conversion", but the Aurigan Federacy cannot tolerate the theft of a system from a so-called ally.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleVaulters">Is it that you lack the courage to wage war, but hide behind propaganda and marketing campaigns? Your continued occupation of Aurigan systems leaves us no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianVaulters">We see this as a gift, as if a member of your kin has joined ours. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRootedMySystemVaulters">We understand the virtues of this unusual presence. Vaulter society hopes to benefit from it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarAmAlreadyAtWarVaulters">Your suicidal tendencies are noted. Once we are finished over here, the Aurigan Federacy will be more than happy to bring you down.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarNoRoomToExpandVaulters">This declaration is not out of anger or spite. The Aurigans are throttled in our current situation, and see no choice but to fight our way out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPlayerAlreadyAtWarVaulters">Your war serves our purpose. My kin see this as an advantageous moment to strike out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralBlockadedSystemAtWarVaulters">Our populations starve, and you prefer to worsen the situation. Why do you attempt mass murder of my kin?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAttackedCiviliansAtWarVaulters">You butcher civilians like the honorless Necrophage. We destroyed them, and if we must, we will destroy you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralAwokeGuardianAtWarVaulters">What monster have you conjured among my people? It will not change the course of the war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralDestroyedMyPlanetAtWarVaulters">I see you are without soul or morals. Apparently butchery is your favorite pastime, and the blood of innocents your favorite drink.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleAtPeaceVaulters">This strange phenomenon you have placed on our system is greatly appreciated, if not entirely understood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleAtPeaceVaulters">I do not see why you seek to cripple my kin while our empires are at peace. What is the meaning of this sorcery?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumVaulters">I see you are proud of your power and glory, but the Aurigans would prefer to rule themselves. Do not take over our systems--by any means.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumVaulters">At this, the Aurigans draw a line in the snow. You have stolen another system, and we do not believe you have any interest in peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumVaulters">The Aurigans are glad you stopped trying to separate them from their kin by converting other systems. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlacedPositiveBubbleVaulters">I did not expect this sort of action from you. The Aurigan Federacy appreciates your gesture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlacedNegativeBubbleVaulters">Perhaps you placed this singularity to ensure that this cold war heats up? If you continue, you will learn that as a people we are unafraid of battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemVaulters">I would never blockade a system during cold war unless I had very specific intentions. Remove this restriction, or your intentions will be clear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetVaulters">You have engaged in senseless slaughter of my kin! It is an atrocity that the First of the Bloodline cannot ignore.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonVaulters">Vaulters have a long history of rapidly adapting. Taking the outpost was simple a question of efficiency, not a sign of hostility.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostVaulters">I see that the outpost has gone to you, and not to my kin. The Aurigans are unhappy, but impressed by your effciency.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoTributeReceivedVaulters">I do not make demands idly. You chose to ignore it, and the Aurigans see this as an act of disrespect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsVaulters">I have no desire to go to war at this point; please simply keep your ships out of Vaulter territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksVaulters">My kin have suffered long and struggled to survive. The war goes badly for us, and we hope you are not a maniac bent on genocide.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredVaulters">My kin face some concerns that we would rather keep to ourselves. Our borders are closed to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarVaulters">Vaulter ships and fleets occasionally need live practice, and your continual provocation has given us an excellent excuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingConquestWarVaulters">My kin are being throttled by frontiers and starlanes; we must expand if we are to survive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedAPlanetVaulters">The insanity of this weapon proves the instability of your mind. The Aurigans will see you punished for this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAfraidDestroyedAPlanetVaulters">Why do you gain such pleasure from the mindless slaughter of my people? Do you find such joy in genocide? No sentient could act this way!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPeaceDestroyedAPlanetVaulters">You view my kin as targets for your weapons of butchery? If other empires do not destroy you, the gods certainly will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsVaulters">I thought that the Aurigans would be safe once we accepted your ridiculous demand. But it seems your mind is not stable enough to comprehend this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleVaulters">It is not that my kin abhor peace, but you use it like a weapon of war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidVaulters">I expected  fleets of ships, not an offer of peace. I will not hide the Aurigans' feeling of releif.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarHostileWaryVaulters">Forcing a peace is like choking someone with dessert. It is not a friendly act, and we still do not trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureVaulters">Your protestations of peaceful appear -- surprisingly -- to be supported by your actions. Vaulter systems are content to see this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceVaulters">You are skilled at forcing peace, but incapable of understanding it. I and my kin do not understand or trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithVaulters">I see your show of good intent. But a more concrete example of your good will would go far to reassuring the Aurigans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedVaulters">You are able to both think and listen. In this galaxy that is unusual, and the Aurigans appreciate your efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedVaulters">I have not seen an interest in your part in our well-being. With no show of good faith, I will counsel the Aurigans to treat you with distrust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionVaulters">Your attempts to suffocate us with peace has only resulted in making the Aurigans angrer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedVaulters">Save your words. Save your breath. We will no longer speak with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationInvadedInCWVaulters">You have your fury, and the Vaulters have ours. Time will tell which burns the hotter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedColdWarVaulters">Your action is unacceptable, even in cold war. You stole a system, and I shall have it back.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedPeaceVaulters">Your clever propaganda and conversion of systems do not fool us. You have comitted an act of war against the Vaulters, and we will respond in kind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationSystemConvertedAllianceVaulters">You spit upon the letter and the spirit of this alliance. The Vaulters will not be spit upon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionGreetingsVaulters">The Aurigan Federacy seeks only knowledge, and a true place to call home…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedVaultersWinning">Vaulters are content to win without destroying. We are prepared to offer a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedVaultersWinning">I find your offer interesting; much can be done in peace that cannot be done in war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarSenderSignedVaultersLosing">I see that the gods do not favor the Aurigans this time. I ask for a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceFromWarReceiverSignedVaultersLosing">Only the gods really know how this may have ended, but we are content to accept your offer of a truce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceSenderSignedVaulters">My kin are unhappy with your provocations. Peace does not honestly describe our current relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromPeaceReceiverSignedVaulters">Your insistance at increased tensions between us may come back to haunt you. The Aurigans do not always seek war, but we never fear it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceSenderSignedVaulters">Your obvious contempt for me and my people is intolerable. Our alliance is nullified, and the Vaulters prepare for the worst.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionColdWarRelationFromAllianceReceiverSignedVaulters">I am stunned that you so violently withdraw from an alliance to agitate for war. Aurigans have long memories, and this will not be forgotten.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceSenderSignedVaulters">Even among Vaulters bad blood occurs. We had hoped the truce would last, but you do not permit that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromTruceReceiverSignedVaulters">Was this truce your flimsy excuse to re-arm and attack my kin? You will regret the day you chose this deception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarSenderSignedVaulters">I am not a violent person, but in this case I am forced to do what is best for my kin: war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVaulters">As First of the Bloodline I both acknowledge and accept this declaration. You will have a belly full of war before this is over.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceSenderSignedVaulters">The Aurigans tire of your actions and words. The only way to force you to listen, is to use force.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromPeaceReceiverSignedVaulters">Vaulters have had many enemies before you, and will doubtless have many more after you are gone. It is war!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceSenderSignedVaulters">Life is full of unfortunate necessities. I do not take war or the lives of my kin lightly. But our alliance must be broken, and the dogs of war unchained.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromAllianceReceiverSignedVaulters">It is difficult for me to see this as anything other than the utmost treachery. Your lack of morals gives the advantage, and the ships of the Aurigan Federacy will do the rest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandFromTruceReceiverSignedVaulters">So a truce was not to your liking. Not enough Aurigan blood spilled? Not enough innocents murdered? Regardless, we are the Vaulters. We do not tremble before you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderProposedVaulters">I do not believe that cold war benefits either of our people. I offer the branch of peace, and the hopes of better relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverSignedVaulters">I will not be the one to refuse this offer. May the Aurigans and your peoples prosper from more peaceful relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVaulters">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationFromColdWarSenderRefusedVaulters">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationReceiverRefusedVaulters">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionPeaceRelationSenderRefusedVaulters">Your words are lovely, but your actions the opposite. I do not trust this peace you propose.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderProposedVaulters">The Aurigans have had enough of provocations and pointless skirmishes. Let us end this, and form an alliance to face the dangers of the galaxy together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverSignedVaulters">I did not expect this! I believe that my kin will accept, and I will not stand in their way. Let us see what this brings us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarReceiverRefusedVaulters">The Aurigan Federacy, quite frankly, does not trust you. We are not prepared to be allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromColdWarSenderRefusedVaulters">The Aurigan Federacy, quite frankly, does not trust you. We are not prepared to be allies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderProposedVaulters">It seems to be a logical step. We can gain more and achieve more in an alliance, shoulder to shoulder.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverSignedVaulters">The Aurigans have learned to trust you. Our peace was fruitful, and we hope the alliance will be doubly so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceReceiverRefusedVaulters">We are not ready for this; not yet. I am oathbound to guard the interests of my people, and this alliance would not serve them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAskAllianceFromPeaceSenderRefusedVaulters">We are not ready for this; not yet. I am oathbound to guard the interests of my people, and this alliance would not serve them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderProposedVaulters">As First of the Bloodline and leader of the great Aurigan people, I offer you this proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverSignedVaulters">It is not as welcome summer on Auriga, but it is certainly agreeable. I accept your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverRefusedVaulters">I do not feel that this proposal does sufficient honor to my kin. I cannot accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealSenderRefusedVaulters">I do not feel that this proposal does sufficient honor to my kin. I cannot accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDealReceiverIgnoredVaulters">I do not have time to speak, and my kin are not concerned with your queries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationSignedVaulters">I will do, and have always done, what is necessary for my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclarationAcknowledgedVaulters">So this is what you desire? I have learned much today.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentSignedVaulters">The Aurigan Federacy salutes those who share our ideals of knowledge and independence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionComplimentAcknowledgedVaulters">I am generally suspicious of diplomatic compliments, but your words are greatly appreciated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultSignedVaulters">My kin and I find you faithless and repulsive; you are like Necrophages, but with fancier guns.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionInsultAcknowledgedVaulters">If I was as thin-skinned and insecure as you are, this might bother me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandSenderProposedVaulters">Do not take this as an insult, but as a simple expression of our needs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDemandReceiverSignedVaulters">I do not know if I will comply. But the Aurigans will not forget how you treated us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandSenderSignedVaulters">I do not care if you think that the Aurigans have not been provoked. I feel that we have, so now it is war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarDemandReceiverSignedVaulters">Let me clarify the position of the Vaulters: if you demand this, you better be willing to die for it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderProposedVaulters">Trade is not the lifeblood of my kin. But we are not so foolish as to let opportunities slip by!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVaulters">The Aurigans are content to deal with you; may we all grow greater in knowledge and in wealth!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementReceiverRefusedVaulters">This things you wish to trade are not the things my kin value. You are like the least useful of the Roving Clans, but with faster mounts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTradeAgreementSenderRefusedVaulters">This things you wish to trade are not the things my kin value. You are like the least useful of the Roving Clans, but with faster mounts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreemenSenderProposedVaulters">Our scientific prowess and our seekers of knowledge are widely envied. Would you like to share in our discoveries?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVaulters">Knowledge is a thing of great value to me and my kin; we are content to accept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementReceiverRefusedVaulters">You would suck our brains dry and in return give us little of value, I think. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderRefusedVaulters">You would suck our brains dry and in return give us little of value, I think. We refuse.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionDeclareWarFromColdWarReceiverSignedVaultersPrepareWar">The Aurigans have faced greater threats and greater foes than you. We await battle eagerly, sure of our fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceWarToWarAcknowledgedVaulters">You vacillate like the wind. If you are really sure you want war, the Aurigans are really sure we will win it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersReceiverSignedVaulters">The galaxy is full of wonders, but also of traitors. If you wish to close your borders, we are glad to keep you out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverSignedVaulters">I am hesitant to give those who are not Aurigans the run of our territory. But risk is sometimes necessary, and we trust that the rewards will be good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersReceiverRefusedVaulters">My kin and I are not feeling trustful or friendly at the moment. We do not seek to have the fleets of other peoples sniffing around our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderRefusedVaulters">My kin and I are not feeling trustful or friendly at the moment. We do not seek to have the fleets of other peoples sniffing around our systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCloseBordersSenderSignedVaulters">The Aurigans have gotten little but grief for our openness. Our borders and our hearts are now closed to foreigners.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionOpenBordersSenderProposedVaulters">I am prepared--cautiously--to open our borders to other empires. Can you be trusted with this honor?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIgnoredVaulters">My counsel is my own. The First of the Bloodline will not speak with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfReceiverSignedVaulters">Vaulters are also not a gregarious people. But we are content to meet you at last, and hope that our relations enrich us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionIntroduceYourselfSenderSignedVaulters">I am First of the Bloodline, leader of the people from Auriga known as the Vaulters. May the Great Orrery tick on in our favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingReceiverSignedVaulters">The Aurigans are questers and seekers of knowledge; we would be content to exchange astronomical data.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingReceiverSignedVaulters">The more we seek together, the more we will learn. My kin are content to share our vision.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingReceiverSignedVaulters">We do not understand why you suddenly reduce our ability to gather information. That is important to the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelTradeAgreementReceiverSignedVaulters">If you prefer to have less wealth and power, it does not concern me or my kin.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelScienceAgreementReceiverSignedVaulters">Our science is the envy of many, and you no longer desire this agreement? I find you both surprising and confused.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedVaulters">Together we can see more and know more. The Aurigans do not find a drawback in any of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedVaulters">The information you bring is greatly outweighed by the information you absort. This agreement is not in the interest of the Vaulters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedVaulters">To map the galaxy and track the stars: it seems unthinkable. Together, however, we will do it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionScienceAgreementSenderProposedVaulters">For many ages we have studied the history and science of the galaxy. Our combined knowledge would be an even greater boon to understanding these things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverSignedVaulters">A truce suits us; we are content to watch and wait.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderProposedVaulters">I do not exult in destruction. What do you say to a truce?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationReceiverRefusedVaulters">I would do a disservice to my kin to accept a truce as flimsy as this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionTruceRelationSenderRefusedVaulters">I would do a disservice to my kin to accept a truce as flimsy as this.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventRandom12-Description">Success! On the fifth day, the rescue party picked up a weak signal coming from a system of caves within the region that the original team disappeared. Upon investigation, they discovered the team surviving inside a Vodyani craft near the mouth of the caves.
Although the crew gave conflicting accounts of what had happened, and possessed equipment that was prematurely aged, they were found to be in fine physical and mental health.
After some simple repairs to the Vodyani craft, both the rescue party and the missing crew were able to leave the surface and return to the fleet. Insights gleaned from the whole affair have triggered a scientific renaissance across the empire.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventRandom13-Title">The Lost Expedition - Disaster</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventRandom13-Description">Grim tidings. It seems your scientific counsel wasn't wrong to warn you that the entire fleet might be in danger should you undertake a rescue mission. Now they're gone, their only visible remains a thin trail of smoke from a mountainous region on the planet.
How?
Questions remain, but something malicious got into the fleet's navigation computers when the rescue party sent a tight-beam update on the third day. They'd been relaying information about tracking a faint signal from the area in which the original team disappeared, when everything went dark across the entire fleet. Then the fleet's engines fired up full-blast, setting course for the planet. They must've tried to wrest control back, but they weren't successful. Every ship hurtled into the mountainside at hundreds of klicks per second.
Nobody would've survived.
Unsurprisingly, superstitious thinking across the empire is on the up.</LocalizationPair>
