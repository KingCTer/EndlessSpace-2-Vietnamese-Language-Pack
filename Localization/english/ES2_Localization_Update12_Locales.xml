  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetMezanTitle">Mezan</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetMezanDescription">This is the planet of origin of all the humanoid bipeds in the galaxy. Successive waves of colonists departed from Mezan to find less crowded or less restricting places in the galaxy--the Mezari, the Raians, the Collective, and certainly others. Once a jewel of a planet, it has become a tragic, windswept vista of cinders and ruins. There are many theories as to what happened to Mezan, with the primary suspects being overexploitation, civil war, and invasion. It will take time and research to find out what the truth is, and what is science as opposed to rumor, legend, and propaganda.
In the meantime, Mezan awaits its next inhabitants, guarding its secrets in ash-cloaked silence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter1-IntroTitle">Chapter 1: Unexpected Entropy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter1-IntroDescription">An emissary from the Academy arrives, dressed formally. They only agree to speak or communicate in public venues while being recorded; this is no ordinary discussion. It appears that the head of the Academy is indisposed, and various organizations within the Academy are beginning to operate with a certain degree of independence. You are provided with a few names, a list, a small explanation--really a marketing brochure--on the Academy's structure and organization.
Once the discussions are over, you place an encrypted call to the Hero in your employ, who is visibly uncomfortable.
"You understand," they say, "we are beings of exceptional power. We are trained to seek only strength and knowledge, but..."
"Some seek more," you finish.
"Yes. And there are... associations. Fraternities. Within the Academy. Theoretically just clubs for Heroes with shared interests. Those who seek power often use them for leverage, however. In research, training, exploration..."
None of this is shocking, though it makes you uneasy. "But as long as they lack access to resources," you say, "they are not a threat. At least, not to friendly empires..."
Your employee nods, as if agreeing, and prepares to end the discussion. Then, at the last second, changes their mind. They add, "Remember that there are unclaimed places of enormous wealth. Out there. And everyone is starting to look at them."
The transmission is terminated, leaving you curious. And concerned.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter2-Step1-IntroDescription">It seems that after centuries of study, Isyander is finally coming close to unlocking key mysteries in the history of the Lost. This close to his goal he has become distracted and vague; he has time for little else than his lifelong obsession. Submitting to his obsession, however, has left his organization adrift and unguided. The result is that some Heroes no longer feel the need to obey his orders, while others simply forget to ask his permission. 
As the mystery of the turmoil is resolved, that of the "unclaimed places" becomes clearer as well. You have learned that some of the Hero fraternities view the Unique Planets as anybody’s treasure—first come, first served. Beneath the serenity of the great void a race is heating up to discover and exploit the enormous riches and power that these planets represent. Some view them as resources to be strip-mined, others view them as historical sites to be studied.

The structure of the Academy is both ancient and complex, with many Pathfinders--Isyander's first allies and supporters--fulfilling key roles. It is in this way that you meet Ighszraasz the Sophon, known as "The Distrustful", who is surprisingly not a leader of science and research but an expert on communication, organization and information. 
As one of the primary leaders of the slave rebellion that was launched with Isyander's escape, his obsession with discretion and the compartmentalization of knowledge was put to great use in maintaining the mystery and secrecy surrounding the development and the location of the Academy. With the tools of the Academy at his disposal, and abetted by his eventual communion with Dust, Ighszraaz was able to instill discretion and concealment in the very bones of the culture that grew up around the Academy.
He has contacted you, in the name of the Academy, requesting some simple assistance. Apparently.</LocalizationPair>

The structure of the Academy is both ancient and complex, and different Pathfinders--Isyander's first allies and supporters--fulfill key roles. It is in this way that you hear of Colorless, an oddly named Craver, who is both a fanatically loyal follower of Isyander and the sharp edge of the Academy's power. Leader of guards, fleets, and troops, Colorless is known to be unforgiving both to the enemy and to his own soldiers. Cold, professional, and unrelentingly driven, Colorless found once again in the Academy the home and hive whose loss had set him adrift. As the right hand of Isyander in all matters requiring physical force, he is the Academy's greatest military hero. 
As an interesting side note, the Tamad-class Hero ship is named for a multi-limbed martial art developed by Colorless after studying many races—including, improbably, the Kalgeros. 
Colorless has indicated that it would be nice if you could assign a certain Hero to a certain role. It would be an exceedingly bad idea to disagree with this simple request.</LocalizationPair>

He is asking that you increase your investments in research and science in order to help the Academy work out the hidden enigmas of the unique planets more rapidly than the rogue Heroes do. He is less interested in what branch of science than in the general advancement, for as a master of cross-referencing and data discovery any research is helpful. You tell him, bluntly, that if he needs CPU cycles you can build a site for him. It seems that he prefers the intuition and hypothesis generation as well as the analysis and conclusions generated by living or mechnical brains, and finds that far more valuable than simple number crunching. 
You ask him how he wishes the information to be transmitted, and he laughs.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter3B-IntroDescription">You learn more from Colorless, and from your most trusted Heroes, who explain that the management of the Academy is divided into three main organizations. The first, known as Respect and Remembrance, is led by a Mezari woman and deals with the study of Lost sites both at the Academy and wherever they are found across the galaxy. The second, known simply as Operations, is led by a Sower Hero; they run the day-to-day operations of the Academy complex and its associated factories, farms, fleets, trading empire, and embassies. The third, known as Integrity, is the military branch of the Academy and features the smallest though by far most dangerous military organization in the entire galaxy. 
Their advice is unanimous: Great changes, and most certainly war, are coming to the Endless galaxy. Some blame this on Isyander's obsession with the Lost, others on the risks and turmoil caused by the rogue Heroes. To prevail or even survive, you must have firm control of your people and your empire.</LocalizationPair>

He asks simply that you improve the experience and skills of a Hero, and that he will learn all he needs to know by tracking the progress.

It seems that Muvel--the name of the site upon which the Academy was built--is a locus of enormous energies, either due to actions of the Endless and the Lost, or due to Isyander's own studies. Regardless, treasure and/or treachery await; you must order a Hero to discover what certain ancient Curiosities are hiding.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5A-IntroDescription">In life one must deal with things of interest and with things of priority. Sadly, the two are not always identical.
While you deal with the societal repercussions of the discovery of Mezan, the events in the Academy and the depradations of the rogue Heroes still preoccupy you. In trying to understand the risks and challenges of dealing with the Academy malcontents, you understand more about the organization of the Academy--which is not as simple as it appears from the outside. It's not really a religious cult, nor is it an organization dedicated solely to science and archaeology. The archaeological site that is Muvel, for instance, is the subject of both daily observances and of remembrance and meditation. While the Academicians attempt to extract all the information about the Lost that they can from the site, some sub-groups argue for ecology--to leave it as it is for future genreratins. It is therefore a living excavation undergoing constant study, and the respect for its original builders is not greater than the scientific desire to understand and decrypt its lore and mechanisms.</LocalizationPair>

However in the place of scriptures or rituals there are textbooks and work shifts, as the Academicians are in fact attempting to uncover all the information they can about the Lost from the site. It is therefore a living excavation undergoing constant study, and the respect for its original builders is not greater than the scientific desire to understand and decrypt its history and mechanisms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-Title">DISCOVERY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-Description">Your presence on Chiark has grown--and attracted too much attention.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-Objective">Send a fleet of $Amount01Name [shipCrew] to the planet Chiark!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-ObjectiveTooltip">You can increase Fleet Manpower through the use of Support Modules.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-Outcome">Heroes cannot escape the desire to test themselves against puzzles designed by and for the gods. You only learn of their presence when they wish it, but Chiark has gained an almost holy status in the eyes of the many Academy graduates that secretly visit. As Heroes face challenges older and more impressive than themselves, their perspectives change, and their desires for power and control begin to seem unimportant, if not childish.
It seems that you have bought peace, however temporarily, for Isyander.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5B-RewardTitle">Chiark can be invaded or destroyed...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-IntroTitle">Chapter 5: Trust in Authority</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-IntroDescription">Part of the troubles plaguing the Academy are a result of its structure. It has two primary centers of study or education, and they often compete for resources and attention. One of them is involved in the historical study of the Lost and Endless ruins and their technological analysis. The other is the public face, because this first, core purpose is voluntarily kept hidden from outsiders. This second domain includes the perception of Hero candidates, their filtering based on their potential, their training and education, and, eventually, the vast galaxy-wide service business of renting out their skills to interested organizations.
Isyander's deepening interest in the first center has left the second with less oversight and control than it needs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-Title">QUELL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-Description">There is disaffection within the Academy, and within your Systems. Maintain your prestige.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-Objective">Produce $Amount01Name [prestigeColored] on the Empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-ObjectiveTooltip">Influence can be increased with Planetary and System Improvements, some Hero Skills, and Luxury Resources used in System Development Upgrades</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5C-Outcome">As the fame and power of your empire grows, the squabbling Heroes take a step back and reconsider their choices. Do they wish to start their own empires, or would they prefer to explore, study, and test themselves against the forces of history? Agreements are reached, memorandums are signed, and the life of the Academy begins to return to normal.
The problem has not gone away. But, for the moment, it has receded. The Academy leaders are grateful, even impressed, and that is no small feat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-IntroTitle">Chapter 5: To Maintain Discipline</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-IntroDescription">In thanks for your help, Chloris recommends that you speak with another founder of the Academy--RH1nD, a Sower who is its operational manager of the Academy. They have developed an entire--and highly specific--management science, dedicated to the operation of massive non-profit archaeological excavations with a large service arm and a heavy military presence. Extremely efficient, detailed, and obscure, the entire set of organizations, processes, technological infrastructures, and sentient resources is known simply as “Gatas”; one of the Hero ship classes (Limo) is named for it.
RH1nD is eager to share their knowledge with you, and urges a complex construction of legal frameworks as the most efficient way to both advance your affairs and ease the Academy's troubles. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-Title">VISION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-Description">The future looks challenging; make sure that your populations are aligned with your plans</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-Objective">Have $Amount01Name active Laws</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-ObjectiveTooltip">Additional Law slots can be added by unlocking new levels in the Empire Development branch of the Technology Screen</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter5D-Outcome">Perhaps RH1nD has simply convinced you to undertake a management experiment on a galactic scale. Their advice has worked, and accompanying changes made within the Academy and other empires seems to have suddenly taken the air out of the rebellious Hero organizations. Is this possible? To manipulate the course of a galaxy via a few carefuly planned administrative changes?
Your mind says no, but the results say yes. This inscrutable Sower may be the most impressive of all the Academicians you have encountered. You hope they do not become your enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter6-IntroTitle">Secret Chapter: Chiark. A Brush with Madness</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter6-IntroDescription">You have discovered that the games of Chiark have a very powerful effect on sentient minds. When the games and puzzles are played, an enormous gamble with one's own sanity is taken. Heroes seem to be relatively unaffected, but unenhanced beings who attempt the challenges come back with deformity, death, or madness as often as they return with riches, knowledge, and insight.
The planet is a game, and a gamble, and clearly intended for the gods. 
Are you tempted?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter6-Title">THE ULTIMATE GAME</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter6-Description">The place is a tangle of mysteries and puzzles. Some of them are so odd and compelling, that a mere sidelong glance seems to entrap your mind. It is not a place to be taken lightly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter7-IntroTitle">Secret Chapter: Mezan. Alone in a Large Universe</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter7-IntroDescription">Time and curiosity have helped your scientists and archeologists piece together the mysteries of Mezan's past. It was deserted millenia ago, and there are no clear records covering what exactly occurred in its final days. Was it invasion? Rebellion? Catastrophe? The different ships that left to explore the reaches of space departed decades, even centuries apart. And yet, at the end, the planet died or was destroyed.
What is troubling is that the most likely answer points to invasion, and the planet's destruction by violence and plague. This answers one question, but not the biggest one--who did that, and where are they?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter7-Title">SOLITUDE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter7-Description">You are in control of the ancient planet from which your ancestors originated. But it is a source of questions rathern than comfort.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter8-IntroTitle">Secret Chapter: Teonha. Involuntary Neurosurgery</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter8-IntroDescription">The Bhagbha are not a hive mind that shares a single consciousness, but rather individual, functioning offspring of a primary symbiote.
Teonha is the central mind, and when it is colonized, and its ecology changed, the effect is quite like having sombody poke around inside your brain without asking permission. It is rather impolite.
There are additional side effects on those who visit the planet; they are assailed by strange visions and dreams as the neural activity of the planet ebbs and flows like the movement of currents. Others' brains can also be affected by this force that affects the Bhagbha, and the result is this unusual mental activity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter8-Title">ENRAGED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%UniquePlanetQuest-Chapter8-Description">Placating the Bhagbha who are offended by your apparently callous actions turns out to be a very worthwhile effort. Sentient being management is never a simple thing.</LocalizationPair>
