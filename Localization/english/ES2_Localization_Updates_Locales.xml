  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter1Title">Basic Fighter</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter1Description">Fighters use advanced comm systems to target and destroy enemy ships. They generally go for Bombers (whether they are acting offensively or defensively), but will target other ships if there are no Bombers in range.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter2Title">Advanced Fighter</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter2Description">This newer generation of fighter is an improvement, as it uses more advanced (and expensive) materials and takes advantage of improved engine and weapon efficiency.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber1Title">Basic Bomber</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber1Description">Bombers are designed to target large enemy ships. Their limited range means they will tend to go for what is closer, but have advantages against larger ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber2Title">Advanced Bomber</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber2Description">Improved Bombers are more dangerous not only for their speed and maneuverability but also for their increasingly lethal paylods, developed with the latest military technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter3Strategic3Title">Heavy Fighter</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronFighter3Strategic3Description">Sacrificing armor for improved weapon systems, pirate modifications have raised critical damage at the expense of some durability compared to the Advanced Fighter model.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber3Strategic4Title">Light Bomber</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSquadronBomber3Strategic4Description">By stripping the Advanced Bomber of some protective shielding pirate modifications have made it a little more fragile, but improved its evasion capabilities, while packing the same punch.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportSquadronDefenseEnhancer1Strategic3Title">Squadron Shifter</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportSquadronDefenseEnhancer1Strategic3Description">The antimatter auxiliary engines stocked in this support module are mounted before deployment. They greatly improve durability and dodge capability of squadrons.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportSquadronOffenseEnhancer1Strategic4Title">Strike Multiplier</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportSquadronOffenseEnhancer1Strategic4Description">These adamantian-enhanced weapons systems are mounted before deployment. They maintain a high level of damage and improve the probability of critical hits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportFlakEnhancer1Title">Smart Flak</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportFlakEnhancer1Description">By using self-aware individual shards as part of larger explosive devices, pieces of flak can select slightly better paths that increase the probabilitys of impact with enemy projectiles.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportFlakEnhancer1Tooltip">Increases efficiency of the ship's Flak against Missiles &amp; F/Bs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportFlakScrambler1Title">Repulsive Plates</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ModuleSupportFlakScrambler1Description">Cycling powerful, irregularly-timed magnetic fields through the hull, this disposable armor greatly reduces the probability of enemy guns successfully hitting friendly squadrons.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-Intro-Title">A Swarm of Locusts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-Intro-Description">Pirates are rarely at the forefront of new technologies. But this time they have cutting edge military systems, and are producing ships equipped with advanced fighter and bomber squadrons. The carrier ships themselves are not very impressive--re-purposed freighters and cargo vessels--but they are loading them with swarms of small but effective interceptors. These new craft are appearing all over the galaxy, threatening trade, travel, and sentient lives. 
It is time to put rivalries aside, get together, and stamp out this new pirate menace. New tactics and technologies are being used, and whoever takes out more of the pirate fleets is likely to have an edge in learning and adopting them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-Description">Pirates are deploying new ships with fighters and bombers. This threat to galactic order--and your imperial plans--must be stopped.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-Objective">Destroy all the pirate fleets</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-ObjectiveTooltip">The locations of the pirate fleets are indicated on the galactic map. You have to defeat at least $Amount04Name fleets to have a chance to receive a Reward. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest04-Coop-Outcome">Now that the dust has settled and the cheering is over, it's time to figure out how the pirates got their hands on such advanced technology. There is a mystery here, and to prevent another pirate incursion it has to be solved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Intro-Title">The Power behind the Drones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Intro-Description">Your experts in techno-xeno-anthropology are unanimous in their opinion: the style, code, engineering quality, and substrates all point to techniques and processes used by the Mavros.
This means that somewhere in the galaxy a hidden research site--well-equipped with both tools and renegade, troublemaking engineers--is selling fighter/bomber technology to anybody who can afford it. Unless this base can be found and this unpleasant business stopped, the Mavros will continue causing trouble for everybody.
On the other hand, engineers who are that clever could be useful if their politics were slightly readjusted... Perhaps a generous bribe--er, signing bonus--could convince them to come work for you rather than somebody else.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Description">Find the Mavros who are building the pirate fighter/bomber technology. Bring along a generous bribe, and you might be able to convince them to work for you…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Objective">Search the indicated Curiosity $CuriosityPlanetName on the planet  with $Amount01Name of [Strat04anti-matterColored]  #EB897C#Antimatter#REVERT# -- but hurry. It's winner-takes-all!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-ObjectiveTooltip">Search the Curiosity when you are ready to pay  $Amount01Name of  [Strat04anti-matterColored]  #EB897C#Antimatter#REVERT#.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Outcome">Well, that was interesting. The Mavros weren't even bothered when your armada showed up at their orbital station; they figured you were just another customer. Now the engineers and their tech is yours--it's time to exploit your investment!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest09-Compet-Failed">Something has gone wrong… Either another Empire beat you to it, or somebody was angry enough to destroy the planet! Regardless, you will not be able to uncover the secret of the Mavros technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Title">A Factory of One's Own</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Description">As it turns out, the Mavros had set up quite an impressive "clean" facility on their orbital station. They were happy to leave it behind, however, as they had reached the limit of what they could do with the station's resources--and besides, luxury shipments were rare. Now that the fiscal and technical weight of your empire is behind them, they can start developing the next generation of their technology.
It all starts with a new site and a new facility, generously funded by you, and staffed by them. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Choice01Description">In order to get the most out of the Mavros engineers and their technology, you will need to build a new Improvement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Choice01Objective">Build the Mavros Skunkworks System Improvement on Empire</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">This is a unique Improvement (one per empire)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest23Choice01Outcome">The work is impressive. For all their reputation as crazed troublemakers, when they are focused and sober the Mavros are superlative engineers. Your fleets will profit from the new factory, and your finest tacticians have already worked out dangerous new battle plans.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroPirate01Title">Bosun Jennifer Rach</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroPirate01Description">Rach was part of a pirate band who broke into an Endless research station and were promptly caught by the security systems. A passing Amoeba ship caught their distress signal, but by the time the Amoeba arrived a Dust-enhanced Rach had already freed her team, cracked the research station lock, looted it, and augmented their ship. As the Amoeba were headed to the Academy she decided to go with them, in spite of the pleas of her heartbroken partner, Sego, and her angry boss, Nico the Psycho, who viewed her skills as a ticket to riches. Thanks to her skills with flight technology, she has since made a name for herself as an inventor and test pilot of new and improbable craft and their uses in battle. It is whispered that even though she has the training of the Academy, deep down she still has the heart of a buccaneer…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPiratesTitle">Pirates</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionPiratesDescription">The universe is full of wealth and riches, and there are those who would rather take what has already been created than do the hard work themselves. While military expeditions generally destroy these bands of pirates or raiders before they become too powerful, one syndicate of pirate-traders, known as ABC (the Autonomous Bastards' Collective), has grown sufficiently large and wealthy to constitute a serious threat to galactic development. Diplomacy and interaction may be required to control them, and an enterprising few may figure out ways to harness their mercenary lust...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementQuestGlobalCompet09Title">Mavros Skunkworks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementQuestGlobalCompet09Description">As tradition demands they are unofficial, off-budget, and highly effective. The Mavros engineers working in this apparently nondescript factory and lab are tasked with developing new military-industrial technology. If explosions are a reliable measure, they are doing wonderfully.</LocalizationPair>

With abundant seaweed crops providing the majority of their diet as well as reserves of biofuel, the Amblyr  civilization is a boringly harmonious one focusing on progress and prosperity for all. Dependable, predictable, and placid, it is unsurprising that X made a break for the stars.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest05-Coop-Intro-Title">Antihero with a Thousand Faces (Part1)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalQuest05-Coop-Intro-Description">It requires a great deal of structure and order to build ships and execute business across the galaxy, and all of that while handling the affairs of billions of citizens. Precision and control are paramount; without them, things could crumble into chaos--a terrifying thought.
However, there is an agent of chaos loose in the galaxy, a strange being from a little-known species. Known only as the Photobomber, his pranks, thefts, and intrusions are destabilizing financial institutions and police forces on many systems. Every time the law comes close, the Photobomber slips away to appear somewhere else, in a new disguise, peddling new tricks and stealing new treats.
It is time to put an end to this; it is time to impose a bit of order on the Photobomber's worrying activities. The governments of the galaxy have pooled their forces to bring him to justice; whoever manages to pinpoint this slippery character will get the best of the donated rewards.</LocalizationPair>

A stolen Hero hull upgraded with pirate technology and a couple of Mavros flux accelerators, the Photobomber's personal yacht is every bit as slippery as its owner.

This troublemaker and daredevil is now in your hands, and the question is what to do with him. Intelligent, if sly, and creative, if unprincipled, bringing the criminal into society could put his talents to good use.
Rehabilitation is the answer, the Photobomber is quick to accept any alternative to hard labor on a rocky asteroid. He claims to regret the error of his ways, and is even willing to work to help pay back galactic society for all the trouble he has caused. Let us hope that there is no backsliding!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPoliticalResult12-Description">The day after the duel, the headlines are filled with the outrage of the people. In a contest held on one of your Empire's outer worlds, the opportunist, once one of your staunchest advisors, shot and killed the young upstart who thwarted him at every turn. 

The witness accounts are frustratingly unreliable. Allies for the young man claim he aimed his gun away from the opportunist, not willing to kill his old friend, but the older man's friends bitterly mock those who claim this—how many times did the upstart say he would "not throw away his shot?"

Nevertheless, there is no public support for the upstart's murderer. He flees your Empire, and intelligence reports have surfaced of him building a rebel army somewhere out among the stars...</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EventPoliticalResult12a-Description">The two combatants meet on a neutral ship in a neutral system. Their lieutentants stand ready. A physician, present as merely a formality, turns her back. The two men raise their guns, say a prayer for their families---and fire!They miss. The witnesses brace themselves for another round but neither men can seem to find the energy to reload. There's a pause, until the upstart says "I think this has gone a little too far."They depart, and soon the story of the duel makes headlines everywhere. The rollicking tale of insults, betrayal, and forgiveness ignites a fire in your people, and soon the two men are lionized as heroes for walking away from the battle. </LocalizationPair>

The beings called the Lost will gradually return, though not even Isyander knows how the galaxy will evolve as they regain their strength.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds01Description">Powerful soundwaves transmitted across the system have two distinct, and beneficial, effects. Firstly, unbeknownst to the local population, the soundwaves are a subversive recruitment tool, encouraging greatly increased military sign-up rates. Secondly, and overtly, the transmissions are attuned to enemy forces' physiologies, reducing their health in the eventuality of attack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds02Title">Magnate's Council</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds02Description">Assembling the best and brightest of your industrial gurus from around the empire is no easy task, but the construction of this Magnate's Council will do the trick. Prestige for the gurus, and for the lucky system where the Council is seated, elevated industrial output on account of their brilliant insights. Especially when the population is content. Just don't say the word "nepotism".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds03Title">Citizen's Entrepreneurium</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds03Description">A vast forum, physically manifested as an enormous complex of public spaces, galleries, meeting rooms, bars, and atriums in the system's capital, but in reality more significant in its cyber-spatial guise. For it is in these spaces that every entrepreneur, no matter how big or small, may share--and glean--hard-won business wisdom. Trade income and population influence rocket.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds04Title">Ultra-wealth Sanctuary</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementDeeds04Description">It might not be the fairest or most redistributive project,  but encouraging the super-rich to harbor their assets in-system can have amazing effects on trade income (not to mention a juicy boost to luxuries). Just try not to pay too much attention to who's reaping the benefits of this economic bonanza.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMetaplot01Title">Lodestone Link</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMetaplot01Description">While battles rage for control of the ancient sites of the Lost, centers can be built in your systems that not only replicate the information discovered from the Lodestones, but also link with them. Stores of Dust, rich in power and data, can be exploited to improve system production.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechnologyDefinitionMilitary33Title">Deep Space Personnel Systems</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechnologyDefinitionMilitary33Description">Deploying out of a perfectly good ship in the middle of an endless void requires excellent survivability and delivery technology. DSP systems do a maximum to ensure that the boarding parties reach their targets to successfully execute their missions. On the down side, of course, it also leads to advances in antipersonnel technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechnologyDefinitionScienceAndExploration33Title">Distributed Fusion</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechnologyDefinitionScienceAndExploration33Description">One way to minimize disruption to complex civilian and military systems is to distribute power generation.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds01Description">A learned institution, where experts in the disciplines of xenology, social psychology and big data can come together to identify the critical individuals who are shaping public opinion across the empire.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds02Title">Information Blackops</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds02Description">This intelligence agency has one express purpose: to retrieve incriminating or compromising information on foreign diplomats which can be used as leverage in negotiations. Monitoring the full spectrum of diplomats' activities and communications by using field operatives working across the galaxy, the empire enjoys less costly diplomatic exchanges.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds03Title">Federated Procurement Office</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds03Description">While massive bureaucracies are not generally thought of as efficient, in this case a highly automated center ships necessary materials, parts and labor in response to battle reports and sensor readings rather than waiting for requests. Ship refit and repair costs drop dramatically, and public servants are appreciated.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds04Description">It's long been known that intelligent life always betrays its true intentions through fleeting expressions--usually facial, but sometimes otherwise depending on the alien in question--that a skilled reader can discern. With this technology rolled out across the empire, diplomats can not only get a better read on their opponents, but also disrupt their own emotional giveaways.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds05Title">Spinoff Incubator</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds06Title">Clear Skies Program</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds06Description">Great thinkers don't always make the best communicators, but under the guidance of the Clear Skies Program, scientists from across the empire can improve their PR skills. As a result, scientific institutions wield increasing levels of influence in society. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds07Title">Terraforming Megasite</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementDeeds07Description">This massive real-time center of atmospheric, chemical, and geological knowledge helps coordinate scientific advances that pertain to terraforming across the empire.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroAmoeba02Title">Glia Lak.Admstr7B2</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroAmoeba02Description">In a eusocial species like the Amoeba, where the large-scale direction of the race is dictated by the whims and desires of millions of shifting, overlapping minds, the ability for an individual to organise the collective and impose a unified outlook is essential. Without such order, the Amoeba would in all likelihood pull in a thousand different directions and go precisely nowhere. This then, was Glia Lak.Admstr7B2's great gift to its species--the ability to shape group gestalts into purposeful units. When this skill came to the attention of Isyander, the leader of the Academy, Glia was invited to share her wisdom in exchange for Dust-enhancement. Always thirsting for knowledge, Glia accepted. At the Academy, Glia did indeed become even more able, but found the organisation's methods at odds with its own pacifist outlook and elected to leave. Estranged from the Amoeba, today Glia scours the galaxy for other opportunities to learn.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Update4LoreDescription">The Galactic Statecraft Free Update offers the players plenty of new options to interact and collaborate with other major players, as well as a series of new features and game improvements. For those who favor the subtle art of negotiation rather than brutal bloodshed, the game now offers new diplomatic means for faction leaders to solve conflictual situations, making collaboration more rewarding and accessible than ever.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Update4ContentDescription">IMPROVED ALLIANCES
New options are now available when players make alliances with other factions. You can now react to your allies’ decisions, leave the alliance in case of a declared war, or strengthen your bond with your allies, allowing you to benefit from faction-specific bonuses.

COORDINATION TOOL
Players can now ask their allies to attack or defend specific locations in the galaxy, by placing a marker directly in the galaxy view. This will improve communication among allies, as text can be added. Note that the AI will also use it and react to your indicators, making cooperation with AI allies a lot more rewarding! Time to work on that pincer maneuver…

PIRATE LAIRS
Minor factions will now only create fleets to defend their systems, and their reaction to your fleet will depend on the locals’ inclination. Space scourge now come from pirate lairs, that can appear on nearby uninhabited systems. Attack &amp; destroy these lairs to curb the pirate threat!

CONTEXTUAL DIPLOMACY
Players and AI empires now have access to a tool to solve conflictual situations through diplomacy. Triggered by specific events (such as trespassing, nearby colonization, …), players will use diplomatic dialog over several turns, where both factions will have choices to make.

ACADEMY &amp; THE HERETIC
The stakes have been raised with the Heretic’s plot now having potentially dramatic consequences for the galaxy. Choose your side carefully…

HALL OF FAME
Keep a trace of past victories and defeats via a local leaderboard, with filters and sorting options. Remember that time you tried Pacifist Cravers? Now you will!

WEAPONS RETAKE
Weapon design has been deeply rethought, and a complete rebalancing was implemented between projectile &amp; energy weapons. Projectiles weapons now have a high risk/high reward philosophy, while their energy counterparts deal more constant damage. Make sure to check your fleets before you head into battle!

PRESSURE RETAKE
The pressure feature has been reworked, to offer a more transparent and clear interface, so players can better see how it is affecting their relationships with neighboring empires.

ORBITAL STATIONS
Increasing your system level and your population will propel new space stations orbiting your colonized planets.

CONSTELLATION CONTROL
The first player to control three systems on a constellation will “own” this constellation, granting specific resource bonuses and showing everyone who’s boss around here.

EVENTS
A series of new events was implemented in the game to enrich the Endless Space 2 experience with more immersive art and story.

Whatever once cursed them has run its course, and this Remnant population is eager to once again settle, live, and work.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroBurraTechseeker01Description">Going by the name of his calling rather than his totally unpronounceable family name, Techseeker comes from the race of intelligent amphibian omnivores called the Plocynos who inhabit a vast swamp world. A first experience with dike and drainage systems led to a life-long fascination with fluid mechanics and terraforming, and contacts with space-faring species served to enhance that. His work while attempting to revive a barren planet led Techseeker into unexpected contact with an Endless artifact that crumbled to Dust as he inspected it. Surviving this exposure, he reveled in the power and insight that his Dust-enhanced powers gave him. Though famed as a teacher of planet-scale technologies and industrial systems, it should also be noted that he is very useful to have around during bar fights.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Title">High-Energy Plasmasphere</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Description">A high-energy planetary ionosphere generates a particularly powerful plasma shield that naturally deflects incoming charged particles or projectiles.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-IntroTitle">Stranger at the Door</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-IntroDescription">For several days, reports have been coming in of unusual emanations at Endless sites. Radiation readings have increased, signals appear to be passing through Dust-sensitive telemetry, and microphones have picked up audible echoes and susurrations. Nobody in your empire has been able to provide a credible explanation. 
Now, a lone Vodyani, claiming to be an expert in Endless archaeology, has just presented herself at your home system with an interesting request. In order to get to the bottom of these readings, she needs access to a very specific system. Her research indicates that this system is of interest not because it is the source of these unusual transmissions, but their destination...
Unfortunately there are already hostile fleets there, and she cannot defeat them alone. With your help, however, the squatters could be ejected, and this perplexing mystery might be solved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-Choice01Title">INVESTIGATE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-Choice01Description">The mysterious Vodyani, Efeb, will go with your fleet to the identified system. Defeat the fleets there, so she can study the system in peace.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">Build a fleet and send it to defeat the fleets orbiting the identified system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest27-Choice01Outcome">Those were not random pirate fleets, they were Vodyani. What interest did they have there? And why did Efeb not simply ask them? You expect answers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NameArchivistName">Trove</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest28-IntroTitle">Living Memory</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest28-IntroDescription">You are in contact with Efeb, but she has not been seen for days. Deep inside the planet she has been working, however; power systems are coming on line and radiation levels are rising. 
She is willing to partially answer your questions. She speaks of an ancient race of gods, known as the Lost, that were beings of pure, primeval Dust. They died off ages ago (though she will not say why), but many of their characteristics live on in the anomaly known as Dust Haloes. Not unlike the ancient bodies of the Lost themselves, these planetary concentrations of Dust could hold vast secrets on the history of the galaxy.
The more of them you can analyze, the better your chances are of getting to the bottom of the mystery.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest28-Choice01Title">ANALYZE</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest28-Choice01ObjectiveTooltip">These Anomalies will blink; search the indicated planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ExplorationQuest28-Choice01Outcome">The radiations and transmissions from the Endless sites were part of an ancient data gathering system. With the Archive planet back in partial operation, some of those secrets may--eventually--be deciphered and understood.
For now, however, Efeb has confessed that she is, in fact, Esseb Veltaros, known as the Archivist, a keeper of secrets and perhaps even a partially-immortal Endless. As recompense for their inability--or refusal--to divulge information, Esseb joins your empire in service as a Hero.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroArchivist01Description">Though this lone figure, who is only ever observed on the Endless memorial day known as “The Day of the Awakening”, has been witnessed and discussed for centuries, there is no clear record that explains their origins. Only myths can be found on that topic, and these are told across many eras and many peoples in every region of the galaxy. Esseb is sighted on this day at Endless ruins across the galaxy—some even say, simultaneously. Are they one entity with teleportation capacity or multiple entities that share a mind? An Endless survivor or an immortal construct? Either way, their sudden willingness to join a faction is surprising. Some believe that Veltaros, whether admiral or governor, is simply doing what they have always done -- observe, catalog, and remember.</LocalizationPair>

Questions still remain as to whether they are sentient, however, for they do seem to react to most electromagnetic waves. Regardless, they are a boost to science and Dust, and their presence is always welcome.</LocalizationPair>

Thanks to a recent surge in your empire's Epistis population, these angular robots are now going from neighborhood to neighborhood, knocking on doors and asking for garbage.

Curious behavior, to be sure, but sociologists hypothesize that it is actually an expression of an ancient evolutionary urge -- the Epistis were designed to be a race of ecological caretakers, after all.

Generations ago, at the birth of their space-age, several vast starships set sail for other worlds. It was a time of great optimism, the travails of the past overcome, and the future bright. After long voyages the starships landed on diverse worlds, the Kal'Tik'Ma keen to learn all they could and see all the wonders the galaxy could offer. They could always return home if they found the planets too hostile. Except suddenly they couldn't, their home star going nova and obliterating their homeworld. Out in the galaxy, only one colonization project survived and founded a rudimentary civilization. Placating the native dinosaurs on a sand swept planet, the Kal'Tik'Ma are now a race of scavengers, forever dreaming of a lost homeworld.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionSefalorosTitle">Sefaloros</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionSefalorosDescription">These unusual aliens developed in an environment of metal-rich seawater. Developing at an early age into tool-users, this evolutionary jump was all it took to make them the dominant species in their environment. As they developed, however, they soon began to use other sea creatures as tools since manipulating metals is not easily done underwater. As a result, though they are formidable builders and industrialists, much of their infrastructure is spun, woven, or secreted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionGalvransTitle">Galvran</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%MinorFactionGalvransDescription">Evolving on a planet with a highly eccentric orbit, this quirk of celestial mechanics has seen the Galvran endure long, long winters where survival is predicated on living deep underground for years at a time. As well as contending with the cold, the ancestors of modern day Galvran experienced dim light levels, and it is thought that this is the reason that they possess two pairs of eyes. With such a challenging environment, it is also no surprise that the race became masters of technology, constantly interrogating nature and creating tools for a means of survival. From hardship sprung solidarity too, and to this day a favourite motto of the Galvran is still "Survive together, die alone".</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSowers01Title">G0d3I Builder.v87</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSowers01Description">Unlike most Sower machines who focus on little more than the mechanics of the job, G0d3I was fascinated by the bigger picture behind the infrastructure programs. Who were their Endless masters? What did they plan for these cities? What greater purpose did they serve? After a period of study and reflection, G0d3I undertook several upgrade cycles, deliberately evolving its core function from passive learning to active operations. In this new guise, G0d3I now puts theory into practice, offering administrative services for client civilizations while still reporting its insights to the Academy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroKalTikMas01Title">En Pas Leba</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroKalTikMas01Description">The common phrase when discussing En is, "She's just like a Kal'Tik'Ma, except more so". An unsmiling and phlegmatic leader, the most emotion a crewman has ever seen her display was when her outmanned and outgunned patrol craft fought off a pirate marauder. "Good", she said. "Resume patrol". It is said that part of her crew's efficiency is based on the terrifying speculation of what might happen if she ever did lose her temper... Until then, En remains the most respected officer in the Kal'Tik'Ma fleet, and the only Kal'Tik'Ma to have received Academy training.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSefaloros01Title">Ooblart Essacius</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroSefaloros01Description">Never content to stay with its shoal, Ooblart grew up a curious, mischievous individual constantly drifting into deep waters and exploring the exotic minerals of the depths. This inquisitiveness, allied with an instinct to create, led Ooblart to become one of the Sefaloros' most celebrated marine architects, designing many stunning structures that bridged the gap between ocean and air in ingenious ways. In turn, this flourishing of supra-ocean construction helped ignite the species' spacefaring nature, and it was no surprise when Ooblart became one of the pioneers of off-planet installations. Today, Ooblart works for the Academy, seeking--and inspiring--more conceptually groundbreaking structures.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroGalvrans01Title">Chancellor Alazne Matul</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroGalvrans01Description">While Alazne was originally driven by a desire to understand the world around her, she quickly learned that she could leverage her skills better by leading teams and thus having more minds working in parallel on the same problem. Rising through the ranks of research labs and public institutes, she was appointed to lead a delegation to Harrow when Isyander made contact with the Galvran. She came back...different, and driven even intensely to study and understand. Her recently acquired habit of wandering empty halls at night, whispering to unseen entities, has not reduced her overall effectiveness. </LocalizationPair>

It is difficult to categorize them in terms of traditional definitions of "life" due to their mineral nature. However, they appear to reason, respond to stimuli, and move (though their ability to reproduce is unknown). As a group they are seeking the "Core" of the universe; a place where the great resonating frequencies of stars, planets, matter, and energy are said to chime in an apparently perfect harmony.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%HeroHarmony01Description">The thing that separates Reflects from its kin and species could best be described as "fatalism". While other elements of the Harmony may rail and fight against Dust, seeking to avoid or lessen its disturbance of their senses, Reflects simply accepted Dust as a new part of its reality and moved on. The desire to understand Dust led it to the Academy, where curious scientists and philosophers were as eager to study this mineral specimen as it was to study their wisdom and ways. 
As a Dust-infused Hero, Reflects has accepted its rupture from the resonances and frequencies that the Harmony relied on to seek the Core. To fill the gap in its essence that no longer echoes and vibrates, it has become obsessed with music and musicology. According to Academy experts, Reflects is now, arguably, the greatest living expert on the creative exploitation of frequencies in the range of 1 to 100k Hz.</LocalizationPair>
